#### Architecture

ThingsBoard MQTT Broker is designed to be:

* **scalable**: the horizontally scalable platform, built using leading open-source technologies.
* **fault-tolerant**: no single-point-of-failure, every node in the cluster is identical.
* **robust and efficient**: a single server node can handle tens of thousands of clients and tens of thousands of messages per second, depending on the use case.
* **durable**: never lose your data.

Application Shared Subscription entity allows you to start using the [Shared Subscriptions](/docs/mqtt-broker/user-guide/shared-subscriptions/) 
feature for **APPLICATION** clients. Once the entity is created, the corresponding Kafka topic is created, where all the messages are pushed that relate to 
a shared subscription.

To create a new application shared subscription entity in the system first of all you need to authorize as an Admin.

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/authentication.md %}

##### Create/update Application Shared Subscription

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8083/api/app/shared/subs' \
--header 'X-Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "test",
    "partitions": 1,
    "topic": "test/topic"
}'
```
{: .copy-code}

The above request will create an entity in the PostgreSQL database and Kafka topic with the name `test.topic` and 1 partition.
The topic name construction is done as follows (MQTT topic -> Kafka topic):
```
test/topic -> test.topic
test/# -> test.mlw
test/+ -> test.slw
```

where
* `/` is replaced by `.`
* `#` is replaced by `mlw` (multi-lvl wildcard)
* `+` is replaced by `slw` (single-lvl wildcard)

**Note,** once the entity is created, you can not update the _partitions_ or _topic_ fields. So, think carefully about the needed topic
and the number of partitions before you create the entity. It is recommended to create the entity with more partitions than fewer since then you can scale horizontally by 
adding new clients to the shared subscription.
Otherwise, you will be required to delete the improper entity and re-create it with the correct values.

For example, if you plan to have a topic to which 5 clients will be subscribed, it is better to configure the number of partitions by the factor of 5 (5, 10, 15).
This will guarantee the load is distributed evenly by the subscribers.

##### Get all Application Shared Subscription entities

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8083/api/app/shared/subs?pageSize=100&page=0' \
--header 'X-Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN'
```
{: .copy-code}
**Note**, _pageSize_ parameter equal to 100 and _page_ parameter equal to 0, so the above request will fetch first 100 application shared subscription entities.

##### Delete Application Shared Subscription entity

Once you delete Application Shared Subscription entity, the respectful Kafka topic will also be deleted.
**Note**, for this `TB_KAFKA_ENABLE_TOPIC_DELETION` environment variable should be set to `true`.

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8083/api/app/shared/subs/$APP_SHARED_SUBS_ID' \
--header 'X-Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN'
```
{: .copy-code}

Paste actual ID of the Application shared subscription entity you want to delete instead of <i>$APP_SHARED_SUBS_ID</i>.

We will create a dashboard and add both a table and a chart widget to view temperature data on the Server and on the Edge. 
Please see the instructions below.

To add the table widget, select it from the widget library, where widgets are organized into bundles. 
Each widget is associated with a data source, which determines the data it displays.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step4" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Congratulations! You have successfully configured the dashboard. Now, when you send a new telemetry reading, it will immediately appear in the table.

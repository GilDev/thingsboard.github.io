Today, we&#8217;re diving into the different flavors of ThingsBoard to help you pick the one that fits your project like a glove. Let&#8217;s break it down, shall we?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Edition (CE)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with the Community Edition it&#8217;s the open-source hero of the lineup. The CE is totally free and offers a solid foundation with limited features. You&#8217;re looking at basic asset management, real-time dashboards, and customizable goodies. It&#8217;s a DIY enthusiast&#8217;s dream, with system admin access and the freedom to play around with the code. Check out the live demo <a previewlistener=\"true\" href=\"https:\/\/demo.thingsboard.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a> before you dive in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Professional Edition (PE) Self-Managed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up, the Professional Edition steps it up a notch. It&#8217;s the premium, closed-source variant for those who mean business. Unlimited features? Check. Various integration options out-of-the-box? You got it. This edition is self-managed, meaning you&#8217;re in charge of deployment and management, but with the added perks of advanced rule engine, entity groups, and white-labeling options. For the power users out there, it&#8217;s worth every penny. Check out the pricing options <a href=\"https:\/\/thingsboard.io\/pricing\/?product=thingsboard-pe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Professional Edition Cloud (PE PaaS)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, the PE Cloud version takes the hassle out of hosting. It&#8217;s the same closed-source, feature-packed PE but managed by the ThingsBoard team. You get everything from the self-managed PE plus the convenience of cloud hosting. It&#8217;s subscription-based and covers hosting costs, making it a breeze to get started. Fancy a trial? Sign up <a href=\"https:\/\/thingsboard.cloud\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a> and take it for a spin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Professional Editions (both Self-managed and Cloud) come packed with advanced features that set them apart from the Community Edition. Here are some of them:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thingsboard.io\/docs\/pe\/user-guide\/white-labeling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Advanced White-Labeling<\/strong>:<\/a> Customize the look and feel of your platform to reflect your brand.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a previewlistener=\"true\" href=\"https:\/\/thingsboard.io\/docs\/pe\/user-guide\/rbac\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Advanced RBAC<\/strong>:<\/a> Implement sophisticated role-based access control strategies to ensure enhanced security across your IoT ecosystem. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thingsboard.io\/docs\/user-guide\/integrations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Platform Integrations<\/strong>:<\/a> Seamlessly connect with external systems and services, enabling an interconnected IoT solution. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To make things crystal clear, here&#8217;s a nifty chart showing the main differences between each edition:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1005\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"3370\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-1005x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3370\" srcset=\"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-1005x1024.png 1005w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-294x300.png 294w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-768x783.png 768w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-1507x1536.png 1507w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-2010x2048.png 2010w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-512x522.png 512w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-1024x1044.png 1024w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-920x938.png 920w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-1600x1631.png 1600w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-1920x1957.png 1920w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1-1320x1345.png 1320w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Difference-CE-PE-Cloud-1.png 2355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1005px) 100vw, 1005px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kickstarting Projects with Solution Templates \ud83d\ude80<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>PE users gain out-of-the-box <a previewlistener=\"true\" href=\"https:\/\/thingsboard.io\/docs\/pe\/solution-templates\/overview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">solution templates<\/a> designed to charge the implementation of common IoT scenarios.

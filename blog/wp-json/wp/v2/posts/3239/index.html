However, as the company expanded, the team faced challenges with respect to the infrastructure and services administration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The problem<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">The product owner at Company ${name} at that time described key blockers that prevented their market expansion strategy execution. Among others:  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">In-house DevOps resources hiring is expensive budget-wise<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Customer deadlines did not introduce room for waiting<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Focus on server-side issues instead of application development    <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">&#8220;Anything requiring constant attention besides the product is a lost opportunity cost for us. We wanted to focus on our solutions rather than the way how to support dev-prod environment&#8221;<\/p>\n<cite>John doe, Product owner<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">To overcome these challenges, the reliability team has reached out to us to request the migration to the ThingsBoard Cloud Enterprise plan subscription. Articulating the above show-stoppers, the Company ${name} aimed to redirect its focus to strategic projects without being encumbered by the complexities of system maintenance and upgrades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Company ${name}, a leading Telco\/Mobile network provider during the RFP (request for proposal) period, changed the requirement from a self-service IoT Hub to a managed service proposal as previous experience ended up as less marginal. The goal was to enter the technical partnership instead of reinventing the wheel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"798\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-1024x798.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3263\" srcset=\"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-1024x798.png 1024w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-300x234.png 300w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-768x599.png 768w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-1536x1197.png 1536w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-2048x1597.png 2048w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-512x399.png 512w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-920x717.png 920w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-1600x1247.png 1600w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-1920x1497.png 1920w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1-1320x1029.png 1320w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Magenta-1.png 2409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Magenta Telekom is a technology company whose SaaS platform helps business and governmental customers manage and optimize operations using an IoT tech stack. The company operates at an incredibly high scale in terms of its global telco infrastructure. Before moving to ThingsBoard Cloud, the Company hosted their own data provisioning solution, but that layer was difficult to scale, support, and, in the end, not always reliable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">\u201cDevelopers and people at the company were just exasperated and annoyed with the unreliability of getting queries to complete or with missing metrics.\u201d<\/p>\n<cite>Senior Director, Production Engineering at magenta telekom<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">The Company is using the ITSM system, and members of the SRE team knew ThingsBoard offers backend logging and monitoring through ThingsBoard Cloud services. After a successful POC and trial run, the customer launched the Business IoTHub powered by ThingsBoard. The shift resulted in win-win technical cooperation where the client has a ready-to-market product and implements their IoT expansion plus access to custom features development resources.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A few examples of why and how the managed service solution hits the self-hosted platform versions nowadays","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":3292,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":"","csco_display_header_overlay":false,"csco_singular_sidebar":"","csco_page_header_type":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Paas.svg","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3239"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3239"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3239\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3334,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3239\/revisions\/3334"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3292"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3239"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3239"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3239"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

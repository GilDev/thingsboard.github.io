We decided to show you how it can be solved with the help of advanced analytics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Solar farms are stations with a large working area, the frequent inspection of which is not financially profitable. That\u2019s why companies conduct quarterly technical inspections on a schedule or in case of serious problems that can be noticed with the naked eye.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">However, many localized problems can significantly affect efficiency in the long run but cannot be noticed simply by comparing a few indicators. For example, the occurrence of corrosion on a solar panel will reduce the solar panel\u2019s efficiency more and more every day. However, the production rate in this case will never reach 0, so primitive detectors will not report the problem. Based on this, the costs will reach from 10 to 40% of the electricity for each day from the string until the upcoming quarterly inspection. We talked more about them in the article about finding anomalies in solar power plants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Knowing what these problems are and where they appear, it is only necessary to build the right search mechanism to answer the question: \u201cIn which segment of the solar plants did the error occur?\u201d. In other words, it will tell not only about the problem\u2019s existence but also about its location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Usually, solar panels are located in approximately the same area, so they are all covered by the same conditions and usually have similar power generation, with a 4-5% difference. The reason for the fluctuation is that solar panels operate in uncontrolled environmental conditions. The power generation of solar panels may vary depending on the temperature, degree of pollution, and humidity, which may differ during the day for each solar panel separately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"596\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-1024x596.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3447\" srcset=\"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-1024x596.png 1024w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-300x174.png 300w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-768x447.png 768w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-1536x893.png 1536w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-2048x1191.png 2048w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-512x298.png 512w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-920x535.png 920w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-1600x931.png 1600w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-1920x1117.png 1920w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2-1320x768.png 1320w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Energy-generating-issues-diagnostics-2.png 2409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Let\u2019s consider the usual structure of solar power plants. Panels were connected to the inverter by strings. Data on energy production was collected from the inverter to which all these strings were connected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">A simple manual review of the data or setting a threshold on indicators will not be enough to diagnose faults. That\u2019s because power generation is non-linear and depends on many factors. That is why we need a tool that can adapt to the task. In our system, such a tool is Calculated Field. This tool allows you to get any useful information from your data, with access to all the necessary parameters and setting up the right logic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">In our task, the desired information is energy underproduction. To find this indicator, we need to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Find how much a properly working line should produce.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Understand the permissible deviation level from the energy production of a properly working indicator that we should set.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">A system that can constantly adjust to a non-constant deviation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">To find how much energy we lose, we need to find how much a string with properly working panels should produce, that name reference value. Compared to the current string Electricity Production, finding the delta, which is the amount of energy underproduced, will be possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Observing the behavior of solar power plants, we concluded that it would be best to take the maximum power output of one string in the inverter like the reference value. The reason is that the strings with panels are located in the same zone and consist of devices of the same generation rate. As a result, the maximum value will deviate only slightly from the other values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"617\" data-id=\"3448\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-1024x617.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3448\" srcset=\"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-1024x617.png 1024w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-300x181.png 300w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-768x463.png 768w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-1536x926.png 1536w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-2048x1234.png 2048w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-512x309.png 512w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-920x555.png 920w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-1600x964.png 1600w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-1920x1157.png 1920w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter-1320x796.png 1320w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Current-vs-Avg-hourly-inverter.png 2409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Next, we need to compare the energy production of each string with the reference value for this inverter. If the value has a difference of more than 10% from the reference, then it is considered that the string has problems with the undergeneration of energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">However, it is not enough to look at energy production at the moment to find the delta. A small cloud flying by or some garbage in the air that temporarily sticks to the panel can affect the string performance. Although the panels are working properly, this would be noted as a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">That is why it is important to take the average value of energy production by one string for the entire sunny day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">At the same time, not all the stuff that gets on the solar panel can be removed in one day. For example, sand from a localized gust of wind can hit individual strings, which will be diagnosed as a fault until it is washed away by rain or a cleaning system after a while. Calling a technical team to this line will be a waste of money. The way out of the situation is to set up an alert when the energy generation seems to be reduced for 3 days in a row.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"574\" data-id=\"3449\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-1024x574.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3449\" srcset=\"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-1024x574.png 1024w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-300x168.png 300w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-768x430.png 768w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-1536x861.png 1536w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-2048x1148.png 2048w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-512x287.png 512w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-920x516.png 920w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-1600x897.png 1600w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-1920x1076.png 1920w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple-1320x740.png 1320w, http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Test-calculation-simple.png 2409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">By meeting all of these conditions, the system can perform constant recalculations in real-time, based on real data, sort it out, and send it in the form of a convenient report to the responsible person. And, of course, this is not the case with just one inverter but dozens and hundreds of inverters that are constantly providing new indicators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">The availability of such a tool will reduce the cost of full diagnostics and make it possible to conduct local inspections. It will also provide an opportunity to find and solve problems quickly, which will increase the overall efficiency of the solar farm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"summary\">Summary<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">In conclusion, the use of advanced analytics in solar farms can greatly improve the efficiency of the system by detecting localized problems that simple indicators cannot notice. The proposed solution uses a flexible tool called Calculated Field, which allows for calculations based on formulas, metrics, and data. By finding the reference value and comparing the energy production of each string with it, the system can identify strings with under-generated energy. It is important to meet 3 conditions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">The delta value must exceed 10%.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">The indicator should contain the arithmetic mean value for the entire sunny day<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">The indicator must exceed the specified limit for 3 days in a row.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">By meeting all of these conditions, the system can perform constant recalculations in real-time, based on real data, sort it out, and send it in the form of a convenient report to the responsible person. The availability of such a tool not only reduces the cost of full diagnostics but also makes it possible to conduct local inspections and solve problems in a short time, ultimately increasing the solar farm&#8217;s overall efficiency. With the help of advanced analytics and the Calculated Field tool, any business task can be accomplished given the necessary input data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">In summary, we have explored how an advanced analytics platform can solve non-standard business problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Proper use of Calculated Fields, prediction capabilities, and anomaly diagnostics together will provide you with a flexible and very versatile tool that will help you customize most of the business aspects of your business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Description of the problem While working with many cases of our clients, we faced unusual problems in solar&hellip;","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":3457,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":"","csco_display_header_overlay":false,"csco_singular_sidebar":"","csco_page_header_type":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Solving-energy-generation-issues-in-Solar-Farms-using-advanced-analytics.png","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3442"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3442"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3442\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3499,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3442\/revisions\/3499"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3457"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3442"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3442"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/wp.thingsboard.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3442"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

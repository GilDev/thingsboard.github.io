<p>Liquid level monitoring system is a process that involves the use of various technologies to accurately detect the liquid level in a tank. This method is critical to a wide range of industries, including water treatment, chemical manufacturing, food and beverage, oil and gas, and many others that require precise control of liquid volumes for operational efficiency, safety, and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>The purpose of Monitor level in a tank is to provide real-time data on the amount of liquid stored, enabling efficient management of liquid resources. It helps prevent overfilling or depletion of critical stocks by creating automatic alerts when liquid levels are too high or too low. As well as ensuring operational continuity and safety, tank fluid levels monitoring systems can also provide information on fluid temperature to optimize resource use, improve environmental sustainability and reduce costs associated with storage and supply chain management</p>



<h2 id="anchor-2">The Explanation how Liquid level monitoring system works</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-zebYbEY3inkJLr57Pqv1i4nT?se=2024-04-16T08%3A23%3A41Z&amp;sp=r&amp;sv=2021-08-06&amp;sr=b&amp;rscc=max-age%3D31536000%2C%20immutable&amp;rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3D7ac8d8fb-bd2c-404c-b581-ef800a305434.webp&amp;sig=P47sLG/llFL87I4400EzzURQROvmT43qYyFNkKrLQgs%3D" alt="" /></figure>



<p>This monitoring can be carried out using a variety of sensors such as ultrasonic sensors, radar level sensors, float switches and pressure sensors, which can measure liquid levels without direct contact with the liquid or by direct immersion in the tank or reservoir. The sensor is mounted on the lid of a closed tank or suspended by a rod or rope over an open tank. Once installed, the sensor can check the amount of liquid in the tank. These sensors typically work by sending signals (sound waves in the case of ultrasonic sensors or electromagnetic waves for radar sensors) to the surface of the liquid and measuring the time it takes for the reflected signal to return. The distance calculated from this time allows the system to determine the liquid level in the tank.<br>This gives the ability to remotely monitor the liquid level from anywhere in the world using a web application or smartphone, making it easy to track of the liquid levels in real-time.</p>

<h3 id="anchor-4">Practical Uses of liquid level monitoring system</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-YVde3PFrnz6psT3DH5BZW86Z?se=2024-04-16T08%3A26%3A10Z&amp;sp=r&amp;sv=2021-08-06&amp;sr=b&amp;rscc=max-age%3D31536000%2C%20immutable&amp;rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dda19d292-c00c-49fb-ba32-2f848a9d8181.webp&amp;sig=SI7pwO0jyXH0pVZdak/2qXuStlzeXpPTr/oPXtcCn3A%3D" alt="" /></figure>



<p><strong>Oil &amp; Energy Industry</strong><br>Crude oil and its derivatives are the lifeblood of the oil, petrol and energy industry (H/T to natural gas, but crude oil takes the cake here). We need tanks to store these liquid substances and everything they help produce.</p>



<p>For example, oil, petrol and energy companies use tanks upstream for production storage, production chemicals, and fracking water management. Midstream, tanks serve as temporary storage for crude products and distributed inventory for specialty chemicals and other liquids needed for industrial processes. We also see tanks used downstream in terminal storage, tank farms, and hydrocarbon processing. On the distribution side, tanks hold fuel, lube oil, and various petrol’s products, such as liquid propane and heating oil.</p>



<p>As Four you can see, tanks are important up and down the oil and energy production line. With tank level monitoring, we can efficiently track liquid hydrocarbons every step of the way.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for Oil &amp; Energy in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hauling companies use smart tank sensors during custody transfers to track how much oil or water they pull from central tank batteries</li>



<li>Oil and gas operators use tank level monitors to monitor chemical inventory and usage related to promoting asset integrity or maintaining flow assurance</li>



<li>Commercial businesses use tank level monitors to measure diesel consumption rates for backup generators or automate stock-out notifications for underground gasoline storage tanks</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Water &amp; Wastewater Industry</strong> <br>Water impacts every aspect of our lives, making water security a TOP priority for leaders and organizations in numerous fields. For example, we use water for fracking in large oil and gas projects. We need water to irrigate our crops, produce our food, and manufacture our favorite beverages. And the only way to ensure we have the water we need is through effective wastewater treatment!</p>



<p>The wastewater treatment industry is a huge stakeholder in promoting water security, which is where remote tank monitoring comes into play. With remote tank sensors, we can monitor distributed water resources that are vital for maintaining water security.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for wastewater treatment in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Treatment plant operators use tank level sensors to monitor separation in quiescent basins and track disinfecting chemical supply</li>



<li>Saltwater disposal facilities use tank monitoring to track liquid volumes for disposed and injected wastewater and prevent overflows in storage tanks</li>



<li>Waste management companies rely on smart tank sensors to collect data around methanol usage rates for leachate treatments and prevent leaks or spills in clarifier tanks</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Agriculture Industry</strong><br>If crude oil is the lifeblood of the energy industry, then water is the lifeblood of the agriculture industry. Obviously, plants and crops can’t grow without water.</p>



<p>If we don’t keep a close eye on water storage, we run the risk of depleting our water before it’s too late to restock. Similarly, we have to stay on top of liquid fertilizer to maintain production quality and regulatory compliance. Enter remote tank level monitoring.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for agriculture in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Agriculture companies use tank monitors to track treatment rates for chemigation</li>



<li>Operators depend on smart tank level sensors to monitor fertilizer and additives inventory for irrigation processes</li>



<li>Sustainable agriculture farmers use tank monitoring to track rainwater collection and ensure livestock have enough to drink</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Food &amp; Beverage Industry</strong> <br>Few recipes work without some type of liquid. In food and beverage production, we use liquids like water, milk, oil, dyes, and other substances that humans consume on a regular basis. And wherever we need liquids, we need tanks that we can monitor!</p>



<p>With remote monitoring, we can track our liquids usage to ensure we produce high-quality food and beverages</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for Food &amp; Beverage Industry in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Food and beverage producers use tank level monitors to monitor market-ready output of beverages</li>



<li>Manufacturers use tank sensors to track the usage of additives, like dyes and emulsifiers, that are used in many food production processes</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Chemicals Industry</strong><br>Specialty chemicals are used in countless applications and sectors. For instance, we use industrial chemicals to support production, transportation, and refinement in the oil and gas industries. Chemicals are also used in the fertilizers that we apply to crops and the additives we put in food and beverages. Chemicals, like water, are everywhere.</p>

<p>There are a large number of oil level sensors available &#8211; smart Wi-Fi tank level monitoring systems, tank content gauges, visual oil level gauges, clock oil level gauges, electronic oil tank monitors, all of which perform the same function &#8211; read the contents remaining in an oil tank. The sensor is mounted on the lid of a closed tank or suspended by a rod or rope over an open tank. Once installed, the sensor is able to check the amount of liquid in the tank and related telemetry. To do this, it sends a wave through the liquid and measures the time it takes for the wave to reflect off the liquid surface. The device collects this information from the sensor and sends it to our IoT visualization platform.</p>



<p>This gives the ability to monitor oil levels remotely from anywhere in the world via a web or smartphone app, making it easy to keep track of the amount of liquid in any tank.</p>

<li>Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP)</li>



<li>Total dissolved solids (TDS)</li>



<li>Conductivity</li>



<li>Water turbidity (water clarity)</li>
</ul>



<p>There is a possibility to track not only water tanks but also pressure of water pump<strong> </strong>and use<strong> </strong>smart switch which operates in automatic mode &#8211; when the water level is low, the switch automatically turns on the pump, and when the water level in the tank is full, the switch turns off the water supply.</p>



<p>Besides IoT monitors smart water wireless monitoring system include next necessary components:</p>



<p><strong>Power supply</strong>: In most cases IoT devices are energy efficient and do not require a lot of power. The are two popular types of power supply &#8211; batteries with high energy density and high voltage (lithium batteries) and energy harvesting technologies for extracting power from the surrounding environment such as solar energy, thermal energy, mechanical energy, environmental energy.</p>



<p><strong>Connectivity</strong>: There are two popular types of wireless IoT device connection to IoT visualization software. The first one is Local area networks (LAN) using Wi-Fi for short-range communications . The second is wide area networks (WAN) using cellular (NB-IoT), satellite communication and radio network (LoRaWAN, Sigfox) for wide-range communications.<br>Integration with<strong> </strong>IoT Visualization software.<strong> </strong>Once IoT devices are connected and powered up, the last step is to integrate them with IoT visualisation software to get a picture of the water tank&#8217;s content. <strong><a href="https://TLM/ Generic">ThingsBoard</a></strong> is IoT visualisation platform which provides a tank monitoring dashboards with real-time data visualisation, trend analysis, usage history. Ready to use Water Level Monitoring template allows easily monitor the status of the tank, set up measurement details and custom automatic alerts like low water levels, opening and closing pumps and valves to detect leaks or theft, also track water consumption.</p>

<p>A remote water level monitoring system collects data on the status of water tanks 24/7. The type of TLM vary depending on the industrial, commercial or domestic use.<br><br>There are different types of domestic water tanks: overhead water tanks that install on the rooftop, open top-tanks installed on ground and underground water tanks. All this water tanks accomplish one main goal &#8211; supply house with necessary amount of water.<br>In domestic usage IoT device connectivity via Wi-Fi connection will be good choice for short-range communications within a specific location. TLM system provide convenient possibility to monitor water tank via Mobile App, tablet or Web Interface using PC.</p>



<p>In commercial usage water tanks are commonly used by water delivery companies to track the quality of the water delivered, as well as by health resorts to store sufficient amount of drinking water. In this case, IoT sensors that support wireless radio communication may be more appropriate, as companies often need to continuously monitor water condition even in rural areas where cellular coverage is limited.</p>

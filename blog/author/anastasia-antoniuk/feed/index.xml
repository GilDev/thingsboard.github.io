<p>In the world of IoT platforms, ThingsBoard stands out with its flexible offerings tailored to various needs and budgets. Today, we&#8217;re diving into the different flavors of ThingsBoard to help you pick the one that fits your project like a glove. Let&#8217;s break it down, shall we?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Community Edition (CE)</h3>



<p>Starting with the Community Edition it&#8217;s the open-source hero of the lineup. The CE is totally free and offers a solid foundation with limited features. You&#8217;re looking at basic asset management, real-time dashboards, and customizable goodies. It&#8217;s a DIY enthusiast&#8217;s dream, with system admin access and the freedom to play around with the code. Check out the live demo <a previewlistener="true" href="https://demo.thingsboard.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> before you dive in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Professional Edition (PE) Self-Managed</h3>



<p>Next up, the Professional Edition steps it up a notch. It&#8217;s the premium, closed-source variant for those who mean business. Unlimited features? Check. Various integration options out-of-the-box? You got it. This edition is self-managed, meaning you&#8217;re in charge of deployment and management, but with the added perks of advanced rule engine, entity groups, and white-labeling options. For the power users out there, it&#8217;s worth every penny. Check out the pricing options <a href="https://thingsboard.io/pricing/?product=thingsboard-pe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Professional Edition Cloud (PE PaaS)</h3>



<p>Last but not least, the PE Cloud version takes the hassle out of hosting. It&#8217;s the same closed-source, feature-packed PE but managed by the ThingsBoard team. You get everything from the self-managed PE plus the convenience of cloud hosting. It&#8217;s subscription-based and covers hosting costs, making it a breeze to get started. Fancy a trial? Sign up <a href="https://thingsboard.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and take it for a spin.</p>



<p>The Professional Editions (both Self-managed and Cloud) come packed with advanced features that set them apart from the Community Edition. Here are some of them:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/white-labeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Advanced White-Labeling</strong>:</a> Customize the look and feel of your platform to reflect your brand.</li>



<li><a previewlistener="true" href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/rbac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Advanced RBAC</strong>:</a> Implement sophisticated role-based access control strategies to ensure enhanced security across your IoT ecosystem. </li>



<li><a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Platform Integrations</strong>:</a> Seamlessly connect with external systems and services, enabling an interconnected IoT solution. </li>
</ul>



<p>To make things crystal clear, here&#8217;s a nifty chart showing the main differences between each edition:</p>

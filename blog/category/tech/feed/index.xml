										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">Welcome to the latest update from the ThingsBoard team! Our ongoing mission to improve the platform&#8217;s functionality and user experience brings us to the introduction of four innovative IoT widgets: the &#8220;Action button,&#8221; &#8220;Command button,&#8221; &#8220;Toggle button,&#8221; and &#8220;Power button.&#8221; Designed with a focus on usability, these new buttons are tailored for the most common IoT use cases, offering users enhanced control and flexibility in managing their IoT devices and dashboards. Let&#8217;s dive into their capabilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Action button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">This button facilitates single-click navigation to other dashboards, states, or custom actions. You may choose one of the common <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions">widget actions</a> to be triggered when the user clicks the button. You may also choose whether the button is in default, activated, or disabled state. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2406" height="441" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons.webp" alt="Tree buttons with different clicking states " class="wp-image-3716" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons.webp 2406w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-300x55.webp 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1024x188.webp 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-768x141.webp 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1536x282.webp 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-2048x375.webp 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-512x94.webp 512w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-920x169.webp 920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1600x293.webp 1600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1920x352.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">More importantly, the button may dynamically change its state based on the value of the attribute or time-series subscription. You may find an example of the button that changes its state when the user attribute is updated below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-2b8b2412-a70d-486d-bfd5-d21e65230e9a" href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tb-dynamic_button_states.json">tb_dynamic_button_states.json</a><a href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tb-dynamic_button_states.json" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-2b8b2412-a70d-486d-bfd5-d21e65230e9a">Download</a></div>



<p style="font-size:16px">The behavior configuration is available in the basic widget settings:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2409" height="1353" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2.webp" alt="Thingsboard basic widget settings" class="wp-image-3718" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2.webp 2409w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-300x168.webp 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1024x575.webp 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-768x431.webp 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1536x863.webp 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-2048x1150.webp 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-512x288.webp 512w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-920x517.webp 920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1600x899.webp 1600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1920x1078.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The button appearance is highly customizable. You may choose one of four available layouts, configure icons, and label appearance. The colors of the buttons are configured via main and background color palettes. By default, the button uses a palette configured in the <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/white-labeling/">white-labeling settings</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2409" height="1626" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-3899" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1.webp 2409w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-300x202.webp 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1024x691.webp 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-768x518.webp 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1536x1037.webp 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-2048x1382.webp 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-512x346.webp 512w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-920x621.webp 920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1600x1080.webp 1600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1920x1296.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Although the button supports all common <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions">widget actions</a>, we will highlight only the most popular in this article. To demonstrate them, we have prepared the dashboard that you may <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#import-dashboard">import</a> to your platform instance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1353" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases.webp" alt="Thingsboard dashboard with five blocks which are demonstrating widget actions capabilities " class="wp-image-3722" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases.webp 2409w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-300x168.webp 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1024x575.webp 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-768x431.webp 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1536x863.webp 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-2048x1150.webp 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-512x288.webp 512w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-920x517.webp 920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1600x899.webp 1600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1920x1078.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">You may find the sample dashboard JSON below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-fd741ad2-e692-4a03-9a23-812a9f191991" href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/button_use_cases.json">button_use_cases.json</a></div>



<p style="font-size:16px">The dashboard has two states: &#8220;default&#8221; and &#8220;other&#8221;. The default state contains 5 showcase buttons. The &#8220;other&#8221; state contains a line chart widget with random data. Let&#8217;s review each button below:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open dialog</strong> button uses &#8220;Navigate to new dashboard state&#8221; with the &#8220;Open in separate dialog&#8221; display option. So, the user will see the line chart opened in a modal window.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="372" data-id="3566" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Open_dialog-2.gif" alt="Opening dialog which shows chart" class="wp-image-3566"/></figure>
</figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open popup</strong> button is similar, but the &#8220;Open in popover&#8221; display option is used. You may also explore various options for the &#8220;Preferred popover placement&#8221; option. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="372" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Open_pop-up-1.gif" alt="Opening popup which shows chart" class="wp-image-3567" style="width:802px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Change state</strong> button simply update the current dashboard state to the new one. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="372" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Change_state.gif" alt="Opening another dashboard state after clicking on the button" class="wp-image-3570"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Drill down</strong> button is similar, but instead of changing the dashboard state, it leaves the old one in the stack. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="372" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Drill_down.gif" alt="Opening another dashboard state with leaving the old one in the stack after clicking on the button " class="wp-image-3571"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open URL</strong> provides the ability to open external or relative URLs in the same or separate browser tab. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="372" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Open_url.gif" alt="Opening google after clicking on the button" class="wp-image-3572"/></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Command button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Command button widget is designed to perform three key actions: sending <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rpc/">commands</a> to devices, updating <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/attributes/">attributes</a>, or appending <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/telemetry/">time-series</a> data. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">You can specify a single device to carry out your chosen action, such as receiving a command. For those familiar with the platform, there&#8217;s an option to use <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/">entity aliases</a> for targeting. This means you&#8217;re not limited to devices; you can target assets, users, or other entities capable of supporting attribute updates or time-series data additions. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Behavior settings enable the definition of the on-click action and condition when the button is disabled. More importantly, the button may dynamically become enabled or disabled based on attribute or time-series subscription. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Execute RPC action</strong> allows you to send the command to the device. You may configure the command (method) name and parameters of the command. The parameter value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. You may send the command without parameters by choosing the &#8220;None&#8221; option.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1542" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7.webp" alt="Form with three fields and apply button" class="wp-image-3736" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7.webp 2409w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-300x192.webp 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-1024x655.webp 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-768x492.webp 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-1536x983.webp 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-2048x1311.webp 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-512x328.webp 512w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-920x589.webp 920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-1600x1024.webp 1600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-1920x1229.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px">By default, we use an un-persisted command with 5 seconds timeout. You may change the command parameters in the advanced settings of the action.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Set attribute action</strong> allows you to set or update the value of the particular entity attribute. The action configuration form allows you to configure the scope, key, and value of the attribute. The attribute value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. Please note that only devices support &#8220;shared&#8221; attribute scope. You must choose the &#8220;server&#8221; scope for all other entities. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1638" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8.webp" alt="Form with four fields and apply button" class="wp-image-3738" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8.webp 2409w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8-300x204.webp 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8-1024x696.webp 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8-768x522.webp 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8-1536x1044.webp 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8-2048x1393.webp 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8-512x348.webp 512w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8-920x626.webp 920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8-1600x1088.webp 1600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Set-attribute-action-8-1920x1306.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Add time-series action</strong> allows you to add the new time-series value for the particular entity. The action configuration form allows you to configure the time-series data key and value. The value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1434" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9.webp" alt="Form with three fields and apply button" class="wp-image-3741" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9.webp 2409w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9-300x179.webp 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9-1024x610.webp 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9-768x457.webp 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9-1536x914.webp 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9-2048x1219.webp 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9-512x305.webp 512w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9-920x548.webp 920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9-1600x952.webp 1600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-time-series-action-9-1920x1143.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px">You may dynamically disable the button based on certain values of the attribute or time-series key. For example, the dashboard attached below contains two buttons that switch the state of the user&#8217;s attribute &#8220;state&#8221;. When the user presses button A, it becomes disabled, and vice versa.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1353" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10.webp" alt="Thingsboard dashboard with two buttons which are change dashboard states" class="wp-image-3744" style="width:822px;height:auto" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10.webp 2409w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-300x168.webp 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-1024x575.webp 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-768x431.webp 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-1536x863.webp 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-2048x1150.webp 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-512x288.webp 512w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-920x517.webp 920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-1600x899.webp 1600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-1920x1078.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px">You may find the sample dashboard JSON below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-8508d6eb-4fb5-4e33-b266-136f058048ae" href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/command_buttons.json">command_buttons.json</a><a href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/command_buttons.json" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-8508d6eb-4fb5-4e33-b266-136f058048ae">Download</a></div>



<p style="font-size:16px">Alternatively, you may disable the button that sends the command to the device, if the device is offline. For this purpose, you may just use the value of the &#8220;active&#8221; attribute or time-series key. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The appearance settings for the Command button are identical to those of the Action button. The primary applications of the Command button are straightforward, focusing on managing devices and assets. This involves either issuing commands or updating attributes to control their operation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Toggle button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Toggle button widget shares many similarities with the Command button widget, but with a crucial distinction: it features two distinct states, &#8220;checked&#8221; and &#8220;unchecked&#8221;. This design allows it to perform two specific actions, &#8220;Check&#8221; and &#8220;Uncheck&#8221;, depending on its state. Users have the flexibility to fully customize the appearance of the button for both states, enhancing its visual and functional integration into their dashboards.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction&nbsp;</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Equipment in production plays an important role in achieving maximum efficiency, quality, and payback. The issues that are key to optimizing the use of equipment are:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Underutilization of Equipment</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Ineffective Production Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Excessive Wear and Tear on Machinery</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Operational Bottlenecks</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Misaligned Capacity Planning</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solving these problems requires constant monitoring of equipment utilization and performance metrics. As production output increases, manufacturers may need to partially or completely change their equipment maintenance strategies and schedules to maintain efficiency. Unfortunately, these problems cannot be solved once and for all. But it also means that we can endlessly improve the optimization process.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">That is why having the most up-to-date data is important when choosing an optimization strategy. Previously, with the help of logging, you could see how the equipment worked at the end of the day or week. With the growth of technology and the help of IoT devices, we can receive raw data in real-time. With advanced analytics, you can turn raw data into meaningful reports and predict future equipment behavior using machine learning models.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equipment Utilization</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">To understand the overall condition of the equipment, you need to operate with a significant number of KPIs. We have divided KPIs by the problems they solve:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Underutilization of Equipment and Operational Bottlenecks</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Production Output &#8211; A numerical or quality indicator of the useful action performed by the equipment. The information is collected using counters, scales, or quality sensors transmitted via the network to the ThingsBoard. The data does not require any additional processing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Equipment Utilization Rate &#8211; measures the degree to which equipment is utilized over a period compared to its full potential or capacity. Production Output is taken as the current capacity indicator. The maximum capacity is set according to the technical documentation. The indicator is calculated by an analytics system that finds the ratio of Production Output to Maximum Capacity in real-time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Percentage of defects &#8211; The number of defects concerning the Production Output. Defective products are automatically detected using computer vision, ultrasonic or X-ray inspection, or by using manual inspection. The advanced analytics system calculates it in real-time by comparing the number of defective products to the manufactured product.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Ineffective Production Scheduling</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Throughput &#8211; Measuring the rate at which products are produced on a machine, line, plant, or across the entire company. Throughput is calculated from meters installed at the inlet and outlet of each production line. After that, the advanced analytics system converts the raw data of time indicators into a ready-made report of the time it took the equipment to perform a certain action.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Time-Based Measurement &#8211; tracks how long the equipment is actively used during a defined period, such as a shift or a day. This measurement is crucial as it reveals the actual usage versus the potential capacity, highlighting whether the equipment is being underutilized or overused. Information is collected using IoT devices or functions built into the equipment. After that, raw time data is translated into a ready-made KPI indicator using advanced analytics.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Excessive Wear and Tear on Machinery and Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Downtime and Uptime </strong>&#8211;&nbsp; Uptime refers to the duration when the equipment is running and available for use, directly contributing to productivity. Downtime, on the other hand, represents periods when the equipment is non-operational due to maintenance, breakdowns, or other issues. These metrics are crucial for understanding the reliability and efficiency of equipment. Information is collected using IoT devices or functions built into the equipment. The data does not require any additional processing.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)</strong> &#8211; This measures the average time it takes to repair equipment after a failure. A lower MTTR helps in reducing downtime and maintaining productivity.&nbsp; This indicator uses the same metrics for calculation as the Downtime and Uptime KPIs. After collecting the data, the advanced analytics system calculates the average value among the time indicators and provides a ready-made report.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) &#8211; This KPI measures the average time between equipment failures. A higher MTBF indicates more reliable equipment. This indicator uses the same metrics for calculation as the Downtime and Uptime KPIs. After collecting the data, the advanced analytics system calculates the average value among the time indicators and provides a ready-made report.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Based on the indicators, this method helps to track production and has more opportunities to react proactively or to problems. Thus, the use of advanced analytics gives us access to:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Maximizing Efficiency:</strong> Companies can identify underused resources by measuring how much equipment is used compared to its full potential. This helps make adjustments to increase efficiency, ensuring that the equipment is not just sitting idle when it could contribute to production.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Equipment represents a significant investment for any business. Measuring its utilization helps understand whether the company is getting the most out of this investment. If equipment isn&#8217;t used effectively, it could lead to unnecessary expenses like paying for machines that aren&#8217;t contributing to revenue generation.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Improving Production Planning:</strong> Equipment utilization data is crucial for effective production scheduling. It helps align the use of machinery with production demands, ensuring that the right equipment is available and operational when needed.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Reducing Wear and Tear:</strong> Overuse of equipment can lead to increased maintenance needs and shorter lifespans for machinery. By monitoring utilization, companies can balance the workload on equipment to prevent excessive wear and tear.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Identifying Bottlenecks:</strong> Low utilization rates can signal bottlenecks where equipment is not used effectively in production. This can lead to insights about process inefficiencies or the need to reallocate resources.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Maintenance Scheduling:</strong> Knowing how frequently and intensely equipment is used informs maintenance schedules. Instead of following a rigid maintenance calendar, companies can plan maintenance based on actual usage, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h4>

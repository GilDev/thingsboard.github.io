										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction&nbsp;</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Equipment in production plays an important role in achieving maximum efficiency, quality, and payback. The issues that are key to optimizing the use of equipment are:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Underutilization of Equipment</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Ineffective Production Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Excessive Wear and Tear on Machinery</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Operational Bottlenecks</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Misaligned Capacity Planning</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solving these problems requires constant monitoring of equipment utilization and performance metrics. As production output increases, manufacturers may need to partially or completely change their equipment maintenance strategies and schedules to maintain efficiency. Unfortunately, these problems cannot be solved once and for all. But it also means that we can endlessly improve the optimization process.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">That is why having the most up-to-date data is important when choosing an optimization strategy. Previously, with the help of logging, you could see how the equipment worked at the end of the day or week. With the growth of technology and the help of IoT devices, we can receive raw data in real-time. With advanced analytics, you can turn raw data into meaningful reports and predict future equipment behavior using machine learning models.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equipment Utilization</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">To understand the overall condition of the equipment, you need to operate with a significant number of KPIs. We have divided KPIs by the problems they solve:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Underutilization of Equipment and Operational Bottlenecks</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Production Output &#8211; A numerical or quality indicator of the useful action performed by the equipment. The information is collected using counters, scales, or quality sensors transmitted via the network to the ThingsBoard. The data does not require any additional processing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Equipment Utilization Rate &#8211; measures the degree to which equipment is utilized over a period compared to its full potential or capacity. Production Output is taken as the current capacity indicator. The maximum capacity is set according to the technical documentation. The indicator is calculated by an analytics system that finds the ratio of Production Output to Maximum Capacity in real-time.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Excessive Wear and Tear on Machinery and Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Downtime and Uptime </strong>&#8211;&nbsp; Uptime refers to the duration when the equipment is running and available for use, directly contributing to productivity. Downtime, on the other hand, represents periods when the equipment is non-operational due to maintenance, breakdowns, or other issues. These metrics are crucial for understanding the reliability and efficiency of equipment. Information is collected using IoT devices or functions built into the equipment. The data does not require any additional processing.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)</strong> &#8211; This measures the average time it takes to repair equipment after a failure. A lower MTTR helps in reducing downtime and maintaining productivity.&nbsp; This indicator uses the same metrics for calculation as the Downtime and Uptime KPIs. After collecting the data, the advanced analytics system calculates the average value among the time indicators and provides a ready-made report.&nbsp;</li>

<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open popup</strong> button is similar, but the &#8220;Open in popover&#8221; display option is used. You may also explore various options for the &#8220;Preferred popover placement&#8221; option. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Command button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Command button widget is designed to perform three key actions: sending <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rpc/">commands</a> to devices, updating <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/attributes/">attributes</a>, or appending <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/telemetry/">time-series</a> data. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">You can specify a single device to carry out your chosen action, such as receiving a command. For those familiar with the platform, there&#8217;s an option to use <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/">entity aliases</a> for targeting. This means you&#8217;re not limited to devices; you can target assets, users, or other entities capable of supporting attribute updates or time-series data additions. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Behavior settings enable the definition of the on-click action and condition when the button is disabled. More importantly, the button may dynamically become enabled or disabled based on attribute or time-series subscription. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Execute RPC action</strong> allows you to send the command to the device. You may configure the command (method) name and parameters of the command. The parameter value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. You may send the command without parameters by choosing the &#8220;None&#8221; option.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Execute-RPC-action-7.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-3110"/></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px">By default, we use an un-persisted command with 5 seconds timeout. You may change the command parameters in the advanced settings of the action.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Set attribute action</strong> allows you to set or update the value of the particular entity attribute. The action configuration form allows you to configure the scope, key, and value of the attribute. The attribute value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. Please note that only devices support &#8220;shared&#8221; attribute scope. You must choose the &#8220;server&#8221; scope for all other entities. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Set-attribute-action-8.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-3111"/></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Add time-series action</strong> allows you to add the new time-series value for the particular entity. The action configuration form allows you to configure the time-series data key and value. The value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Add-time-series-action-9.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-3112"/></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px">You may dynamically disable the button based on certain values of the attribute or time-series key. For example, the dashboard attached below contains two buttons that switch the state of the user&#8217;s attribute &#8220;state&#8221;. When the user presses button A, it becomes disabled, and vice versa.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Disabled-state-10.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-3113" style="width:822px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px">You may find the sample dashboard JSON below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-8508d6eb-4fb5-4e33-b266-136f058048ae" href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/command_buttons.json">command_buttons.json</a><a href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/command_buttons.json" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-8508d6eb-4fb5-4e33-b266-136f058048ae">Download</a></div>



<p style="font-size:16px">Alternatively, you may disable the button that sends the command to the device, if the device is offline. For this purpose, you may just use the value of the &#8220;active&#8221; attribute or time-series key. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The appearance settings for the Command button are identical to those of the Action button. The primary applications of the Command button are straightforward, focusing on managing devices and assets. This involves either issuing commands or updating attributes to control their operation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Toggle button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Toggle button widget shares many similarities with the Command button widget, but with a crucial distinction: it features two distinct states, &#8220;checked&#8221; and &#8220;unchecked&#8221;. This design allows it to perform two specific actions, &#8220;Check&#8221; and &#8220;Uncheck&#8221;, depending on its state. Users have the flexibility to fully customize the appearance of the button for both states, enhancing its visual and functional integration into their dashboards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Toggle-button-widget-1.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-3115"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The default behavior will change the state of the device using the &#8220;setState&#8221; command:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Behavior-1.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-3121"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">You may easily change this button to operate with the &#8220;state&#8221; attribute instead of sending commands to devices:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Behavior123-1.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-3122"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Toggle button shares appearance settings with the Command button but allows separate configurations for its &#8220;Checked&#8221; and &#8220;Unchecked&#8221; states:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Button-appearance-1.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-3123"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Adjusting the border radius, background colors, and other appearance settings can significantly alter the button&#8217;s style:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="803" height="208" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Buttons123.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3120" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Buttons123.png 803w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Buttons123-300x78.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Buttons123-768x199.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Buttons123-512x133.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Power button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Power button widget, similar to the Toggle button, differs in appearance and has three states: &#8216;On&#8217;, &#8216;Off&#8217; and disabled, with six customizable layouts:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Power-button-widget.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The appearance settings are simplified compared to the Command button. Basically, you are able to configure main and background colors for every state.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Button-appearance-2.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-3125"/></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px">The Power button widget enables remote control of devices across sectors: turning smart home appliances on/off, managing industrial equipment, controlling servers, adjusting energy sources, operating irrigation systems, managing healthcare devices, retail displays, and public lighting, showcasing its versatility in simplifying power management in IoT applications.</p>

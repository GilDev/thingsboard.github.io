<p>Liquid level monitoring system is a process that involves the use of various technologies to accurately detect the liquid level in a tank. This method is critical to a wide range of industries, including water treatment, chemical manufacturing, food and beverage, oil and gas, and many others that require precise control of liquid volumes for operational efficiency, safety, and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>The purpose of Monitor level in a tank is to provide real-time data on the amount of liquid stored, enabling efficient management of liquid resources. It helps prevent overfilling or depletion of critical stocks by creating automatic alerts when liquid levels are too high or too low. As well as ensuring operational continuity and safety, tank fluid levels monitoring systems can also provide information on fluid temperature to optimize resource use, improve environmental sustainability and reduce costs associated with storage and supply chain management</p>



<h2 id="anchor-2">The Explanation how Liquid level monitoring system works</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-zebYbEY3inkJLr57Pqv1i4nT?se=2024-04-16T08%3A23%3A41Z&amp;sp=r&amp;sv=2021-08-06&amp;sr=b&amp;rscc=max-age%3D31536000%2C%20immutable&amp;rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3D7ac8d8fb-bd2c-404c-b581-ef800a305434.webp&amp;sig=P47sLG/llFL87I4400EzzURQROvmT43qYyFNkKrLQgs%3D" alt="" /></figure>



<p>This monitoring can be carried out using a variety of sensors such as ultrasonic sensors, radar level sensors, float switches and pressure sensors, which can measure liquid levels without direct contact with the liquid or by direct immersion in the tank or reservoir. The sensor is mounted on the lid of a closed tank or suspended by a rod or rope over an open tank. Once installed, the sensor can check the amount of liquid in the tank. These sensors typically work by sending signals (sound waves in the case of ultrasonic sensors or electromagnetic waves for radar sensors) to the surface of the liquid and measuring the time it takes for the reflected signal to return. The distance calculated from this time allows the system to determine the liquid level in the tank.<br>This gives the ability to remotely monitor the liquid level from anywhere in the world using a web application or smartphone, making it easy to track of the liquid levels in real-time.</p>

<h3 id="anchor-4">Practical Uses of liquid level monitoring system</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-YVde3PFrnz6psT3DH5BZW86Z?se=2024-04-16T08%3A26%3A10Z&amp;sp=r&amp;sv=2021-08-06&amp;sr=b&amp;rscc=max-age%3D31536000%2C%20immutable&amp;rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dda19d292-c00c-49fb-ba32-2f848a9d8181.webp&amp;sig=SI7pwO0jyXH0pVZdak/2qXuStlzeXpPTr/oPXtcCn3A%3D" alt="" /></figure>



<p><strong>Oil &amp; Energy Industry</strong><br>Crude oil and its derivatives are the lifeblood of the oil, petrol and energy industry (H/T to natural gas, but crude oil takes the cake here). We need tanks to store these liquid substances and everything they help produce.</p>



<p>For example, oil, petrol and energy companies use tanks upstream for production storage, production chemicals, and fracking water management. Midstream, tanks serve as temporary storage for crude products and distributed inventory for specialty chemicals and other liquids needed for industrial processes. We also see tanks used downstream in terminal storage, tank farms, and hydrocarbon processing. On the distribution side, tanks hold fuel, lube oil, and various petrol’s products, such as liquid propane and heating oil.</p>



<p>As Four you can see, tanks are important up and down the oil and energy production line. With tank level monitoring, we can efficiently track liquid hydrocarbons every step of the way.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for Oil &amp; Energy in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hauling companies use smart tank sensors during custody transfers to track how much oil or water they pull from central tank batteries</li>



<li>Oil and gas operators use tank level monitors to monitor chemical inventory and usage related to promoting asset integrity or maintaining flow assurance</li>



<li>Commercial businesses use tank level monitors to measure diesel consumption rates for backup generators or automate stock-out notifications for underground gasoline storage tanks</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Water &amp; Wastewater Industry</strong> <br>Water impacts every aspect of our lives, making water security a TOP priority for leaders and organizations in numerous fields. For example, we use water for fracking in large oil and gas projects. We need water to irrigate our crops, produce our food, and manufacture our favorite beverages. And the only way to ensure we have the water we need is through effective wastewater treatment!</p>



<p>The wastewater treatment industry is a huge stakeholder in promoting water security, which is where remote tank monitoring comes into play. With remote tank sensors, we can monitor distributed water resources that are vital for maintaining water security.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for wastewater treatment in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Treatment plant operators use tank level sensors to monitor separation in quiescent basins and track disinfecting chemical supply</li>



<li>Saltwater disposal facilities use tank monitoring to track liquid volumes for disposed and injected wastewater and prevent overflows in storage tanks</li>



<li>Waste management companies rely on smart tank sensors to collect data around methanol usage rates for leachate treatments and prevent leaks or spills in clarifier tanks</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Agriculture Industry</strong><br>If crude oil is the lifeblood of the energy industry, then water is the lifeblood of the agriculture industry. Obviously, plants and crops can’t grow without water.</p>



<p>If we don’t keep a close eye on water storage, we run the risk of depleting our water before it’s too late to restock. Similarly, we have to stay on top of liquid fertilizer to maintain production quality and regulatory compliance. Enter remote tank level monitoring.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for agriculture in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Agriculture companies use tank monitors to track treatment rates for chemigation</li>



<li>Operators depend on smart tank level sensors to monitor fertilizer and additives inventory for irrigation processes</li>



<li>Sustainable agriculture farmers use tank monitoring to track rainwater collection and ensure livestock have enough to drink</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Food &amp; Beverage Industry</strong> <br>Few recipes work without some type of liquid. In food and beverage production, we use liquids like water, milk, oil, dyes, and other substances that humans consume on a regular basis. And wherever we need liquids, we need tanks that we can monitor!</p>



<p>With remote monitoring, we can track our liquids usage to ensure we produce high-quality food and beverages</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for Food &amp; Beverage Industry in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Food and beverage producers use tank level monitors to monitor market-ready output of beverages</li>



<li>Manufacturers use tank sensors to track the usage of additives, like dyes and emulsifiers, that are used in many food production processes</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Chemicals Industry</strong><br>Specialty chemicals are used in countless applications and sectors. For instance, we use industrial chemicals to support production, transportation, and refinement in the oil and gas industries. Chemicals are also used in the fertilizers that we apply to crops and the additives we put in food and beverages. Chemicals, like water, are everywhere.</p>

<p>There are a large number of oil level sensors available &#8211; smart Wi-Fi tank level monitoring systems, tank content gauges, visual oil level gauges, clock oil level gauges, electronic oil tank monitors, all of which perform the same function &#8211; read the contents remaining in an oil tank. The sensor is mounted on the lid of a closed tank or suspended by a rod or rope over an open tank. Once installed, the sensor is able to check the amount of liquid in the tank and related telemetry. To do this, it sends a wave through the liquid and measures the time it takes for the wave to reflect off the liquid surface. The device collects this information from the sensor and sends it to our IoT visualization platform.</p>



<p>This gives the ability to monitor oil levels remotely from anywhere in the world via a web or smartphone app, making it easy to keep track of the amount of liquid in any tank.</p>

<li>Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP)</li>



<li>Total dissolved solids (TDS)</li>



<li>Conductivity</li>



<li>Water turbidity (water clarity)</li>
</ul>



<p>There is a possibility to track not only water tanks but also pressure of water pump<strong> </strong>and use<strong> </strong>smart switch which operates in automatic mode &#8211; when the water level is low, the switch automatically turns on the pump, and when the water level in the tank is full, the switch turns off the water supply.</p>



<p>Besides IoT monitors smart water wireless monitoring system include next necessary components:</p>



<p><strong>Power supply</strong>: In most cases IoT devices are energy efficient and do not require a lot of power. The are two popular types of power supply &#8211; batteries with high energy density and high voltage (lithium batteries) and energy harvesting technologies for extracting power from the surrounding environment such as solar energy, thermal energy, mechanical energy, environmental energy.</p>



<p><strong>Connectivity</strong>: There are two popular types of wireless IoT device connection to IoT visualization software. The first one is Local area networks (LAN) using Wi-Fi for short-range communications . The second is wide area networks (WAN) using cellular (NB-IoT), satellite communication and radio network (LoRaWAN, Sigfox) for wide-range communications.<br>Integration with<strong> </strong>IoT Visualization software.<strong> </strong>Once IoT devices are connected and powered up, the last step is to integrate them with IoT visualisation software to get a picture of the water tank&#8217;s content. <strong><a href="https://TLM/ Generic">ThingsBoard</a></strong> is IoT visualisation platform which provides a tank monitoring dashboards with real-time data visualisation, trend analysis, usage history.

					<description><![CDATA[Solar power plants face issues due to temperature and environmental factors, which lead to reduced efficiency and potential&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants face issues due to temperature and environmental factors, which lead to reduced efficiency and potential major breakdowns if not addressed quickly. The challenge is that monitoring tools like drones, digital multimeters, and infrared cameras are costly, making regular checks infrequent, which does not allow quick responses to problems. This means that if a problem arises after a maintenance check, electricity production efficiency will fall, leading to significant losses.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The ability to quickly respond to problems</strong>&nbsp;is what plants with constant energy production need.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">One of the ways to achieve a quick response to problems is through the use of anomaly detection. Using this method provides an opportunity to respond to problems quickly and significantly reduces the spending on third-party equipment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-1024x574.webp" alt="Thingsboard dashboard with chart and two tables with lists of alarms and annomaly situations" class="wp-image-3765" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-1024x574.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-768x430.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-1536x861.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-2048x1148.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-512x287.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-920x516.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-1600x897.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-1920x1076.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Anomaly detection is a technique to identify patterns or events deviating from the norm. In the context of a solar farm, this can involve monitoring various factors, such as Real-time Energy Output, Power Generation Trends, Solar Irradiance, and Temperature for Solar Panels. Also Output Voltage and Current, Frequency, Efficiency, Temperature for Inverter. By analyzing this data, anomaly detection algorithms can identify unusual patterns or events that may indicate problems before they can do any damage to the solar panel or inverter. In other words, we look for a problem not when we see that energy is produced less than expected for the second day in a row but right at the moment when the problem appeared.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">But, unusual patterns are not just deviations of parameters from the norm.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Unusual patterns are combinations of parameters that are not expected but which identify potential problems. They are discovered by analyzing historical data collected from solar panels and inverters. During this analysis, we focus not only on individual parameter values but on a combination of values because it potentially gives more insights into system behavior. Based on this, it is possible to find current problems and predict future ones.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">A person cannot cope with the calculations of such data arrays. That is why we need advanced analytics with machine learning capabilities to analyze historical data and find unusual patterns in real-time.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Now, we will show how to configure Trends Analytics for correct anomaly detection. However, before that, let’s consider what types of anomalies occur in Solar Farms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="overview-of-common-anomalies-in-equipment-of-solar-power-plants">Overview of common anomalies in the equipment of solar power plants</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The most widespread and important problems for us are those with solar panels and inverters since these are the first frontier of obtaining energy. Therefore, we will look for anomalies in these parts of the power plant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="anomalies-in-photovoltaic-modules">Anomalies in photovoltaic modules</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Below, the most common breakdowns in PV modules and solar panels, which can be quickly and economically solved if they are dealt with immediately, will be described.<br><br>Most of them are formed on separate panels, so a drop in the indicators of one panel in contrast to another will indicate a breakdown. You can find each of them by finding anomalies in the Output Electricity (voltage and current) and Power Production indicators from the solar panel.</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Soiling:</strong> Soiling refers to the accumulation of dirt, dust, bird droppings, or other materials on the surface of solar panels. This layer of grime can significantly reduce the panels’ ability to absorb sunlight, leading to decreased electricity production.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Shading:</strong>&nbsp;Shading occurs when an object, such as a tree, building, or another solar panel, casts a shadow on a solar panel. This can lead to a reduction in the panel’s electricity production. Prolonged shadowing can lead to an imbalance in the solar panel system and may cause hot spots or reduce the overall lifespan of the panel.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Delamination and Internal Corrosion:</strong>&nbsp;Moisture can find its way into the panel, causing internal corrosion, if the panels are not keeping out air and water and all the solar panel components are not laminated correctly.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Identifying and Addressing Solar Panel Anomalies Faulty wiring, loose connections, corrosion, and oxidation can interfere with electricity production.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Hot Spots:</strong>&nbsp;Badly-soldered connections can cause low resistance in the part of the panel that receives the power generated by the cell, leading to a hotspot in the soldered points and/or a cell. This phenomenon can ultimately lead to a short circuit, reducing the performance and lifespan of the PV panel.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>PID Effect:</strong>&nbsp;Potential-induced degradation (PID) can cause an ongoing reduction in performance and accelerated aging of the PV panel. PID occurs when the voltage potential between the solar cells and the grounded frame of the panel causes a leakage current that can damage the cells.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Snail Trail Contamination:</strong>&nbsp;Snail trail contamination is a phenomenon where a white or grayish residue appears on the surface of the solar panel. This residue can reduce the performance of the panel and is caused by the release of silicone from the panel’s encapsulant material.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="tackling-anomalies-in-inverters">Tackling Anomalies in Inverters</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Inverters are a very important link of a solar power plant, a breakdown of which can lead to the shutdown of the entire power plant. This can have a critical impact on the total efficiency and profitability of the power plant.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">You can observe the operation of the inverter by following the indicators Output Voltage and Current, Frequency, Efficiency, and Temperature.</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Overheating:</strong>&nbsp;Inverters are sensitive to temperature, and high temperatures can reduce production and potentially a stoppage altogether if overheating occurs as the maximum operating temperature is reached. To prevent overheating, it is important to keep the switch cabinet and the area where the inverter is located well-ventilated, along with the inclusion of cleaning dust filters that can prevent any issues impeding airflow. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Temperature, Output Voltage, and Current.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Isolation Short-Circuit Fault:</strong>&nbsp;If there is too much moisture or damage to the cabling sleeves, then an isolation short-circuit fault can occur, whereby the inverter will report an “isolation alarm”. In this scenario, the solar inverter will either work at the minimum “required” isolation level or stop working altogether. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Efficiency, Output Voltage, and Current.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Inverter Does Not Restart:</strong>&nbsp;Inverters sometimes fail to restart after a power outage. Various factors, including a faulty inverter, a tripped circuit breaker, or a blown fuse, can cause this. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Frequency, and Efficiency.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Module:</strong>&nbsp;The MPPT module is responsible for tracking the maximum power point of the solar panel array. If the MPPT module fails, the inverter cannot convert the DC electricity generated by the solar panels into AC electricity. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Temperature, Output Voltage, and Current.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="summary">Summary</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Efficiency challenges in solar farm operations demand a proactive approach to problem-solving, particularly in the context of scheduled diagnostics and high equipment maintenance costs. Anomaly detection emerges as a cost-effective solution, leveraging historical data to identify deviations in parameters like Real-time Energy Output, Power Generation Trends, and Temperature for Solar Panels, along with Output Voltage, Current, Frequency, and Efficiency for Inverters. This approach helps quickly find current problems and predict future issues, which is important for keeping the energy production going without any interruptions.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">To implement this approach, an efficient strategy involves creating anomaly detection models based on historical telemetry data, configuring real-time anomaly detection, and providing a comprehensive dashboard for the maintenance team. This ensures a streamlined process from anomaly identification to resolution, utilizing Trendz Analytics to enhance solar farm efficiency by minimizing downtime, reducing operational costs, and optimizing long-term performance.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">And this is only part of how advanced analytics and machine learning can improve the efficiency of solar farms. With help, you can find solutions to your solar farm problems, including Soiling, Battery Health Diagnostics, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">For solar farms, dirty panels can mean thousands of dollars of lost revenue annually. Panels washed too early or too late – are costs that make up a serious portion of the power plant’s profitability.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">In one of our cases, we worked with a Spanish company, a producer of electricity. They owned a solar power plant with a capacity of 10 MW. They will produce about $260,000 worth of energy per month in ideal conditions. However, the company lost over a fifth of its energy due to soiling problems. In turn, the cost of the cleaning cycle was $50,000. Calculating the losses, it was clear that cleaning on a fixed schedule was showing poor results.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1024x574.webp" alt="Thingsboard dashboard with charts and lists solar panels statistics " class="wp-image-3758" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1024x574.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-768x430.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1536x861.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-2048x1148.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-512x287.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-920x516.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1600x897.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1920x1076.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">To get the best possible results, you need to be sure of 3 steps:</p>



<ol>
<li style="font-size:16px">We have to find the energy losses</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">We need to know the forecast for electricity losses.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">You need to find the best time for the cleaning cycle.</li>
</ol>



<p style="font-size:16px">The key to solving all these questions is advanced analytics. A correctly configured system, like an expert, automatically decides what to do based on real-time and forecasted data and can manage the entire cleaning cycle, from collecting information to turning on the irrigation system or calling a group of cleaners without outside intervention.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Using IoT sensors to track real-time solar generation data, our solution provides actionable intelligence to optimize your cleaning schedule. Here’s how it works:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Sensors are installed to monitor energy production from individual panels. This allows precise tracking of solar output over time.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Advanced analytics calculate expected energy generation based on weather conditions and other variables. The difference between expected and available energy generation is considered energy loss.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Our algorithm evaluates the cost of cleaning against potential energy savings. It forecasts lost revenue accrued each day panels remain dirty.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">When the value of regained energy outweighs cleaning expenses, the system automatically alerts owners it’s time to wash or turn off/on the cleaning system.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Targeted cleanings restore generation at the optimal moment. You have the opportunity to adjust the cleaning schedule based on the economic feasibility of your decisions.</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Customers using our solar IoT solution have increased generation by 5-15% while reducing cleaning costs by up to 40%. Solar assets stay active at peak efficiency by timing cleanings precisely when needed.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="effective-solar-panel-cleaning-how-to-optimize-solar-panel-cleaning-schedule">Effective Solar Panel Cleaning. How to optimize Solar Panel cleaning schedule</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Our approach to solving this problem is based on Soiling cost calculation.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Soiling costs are the losses you will incur if you clean your station on this day. This indicator consists of&nbsp;<strong>the cost of cleaning</strong> for a 10 MW plant, which is approximately $50,000,&nbsp;<strong>the sum of all losses</strong>&nbsp;due to pollution, and all this is divided by the number of&nbsp;<strong>days</strong>&nbsp;since the last cleaning.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The indicator drops – good because our costs are decreasing. The indicator starts to rise – you need to wash the panels because the current costs are at their lowest point and then will constantly grow, and that is exactly the point when cleaning is economically feasible. As we can see in the table, in the dry period, when the loss indicators are only growing, the 5th week is the best time to carry out the cleaning cycle because compared to cleaning in any other week, the price is the lowest.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">That is why we need to set up an IoT system with advanced analytics to optimize the cleaning schedule based on the historical data from the solar plant, the production forecast, and the metrics we explained in this section.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="summary">Summary</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants have many advantages, but due to their novelty, they also have many disadvantages. One of the most common is overspending based on pollution. This is a problem that cannot be eliminated, so the goal – is to minimize losses. Using IoT technologies and advanced analytics, you can easily monitor and wash solar panels at exactly the point in time when cleaning is economically feasible.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Analytics, IoT, and machine learning provide insights, risk forecasts, and data-driven decisions for better business performance. Embracing these ensures competitiveness and risk mitigation. Also, in the future, we plan to tell you how to improve the efficiency of the power plant by finding anomalies in the solar panels and parts of the power plant, such as the inverter or the battery. In our digital age, advanced analytics are the way to simplify and boost complex problem-solving!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">Solar energy is becoming increasingly popular as the world looks to resolve the climate emergency and move toward a greener future. However, solar farms face several energy-generating challenges, including operating and maintenance costs, soiling, performance degradation over time, security and intrusion detection, optimizing energy output, and grid integration challenges.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">To address these issues, they increasingly rely on advanced analytics to optimize their operations, monitor weather conditions, and raise maintenance processes. Here, we’ll explore the main challenges faced by solar panels, as well as options for solving them with the help of advanced analytics.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Threshold business analytics approaches cannot deal with the complexity of solar power plant data and the problems that arise. Predictive maintenance, forecasting, and anomaly detection will be the main tools for solving challenges. Solar farms adopting such smart analytics tools have already seen benefits like 12-15% gains in annual energy yield, 15-20% drops in cleaning and maintenance costs, and 30% reductions in power output volatility. By leveraging these tools, solar farms can significantly increase their overall efficiency, reduce downtime, and lower their overall cost of operation.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The article aims to educate readers on the problems and the solutions to aid faster industry adoption of analytics. Continued efforts in this direction can help solar power advance strongly towards its promise of a brighter, cleaner energy future.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="solar-farm-structure">Solar Farm Structure</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar farms consist of solar panels, wires, inverters, batteries, and a utility meter. Due to the design features, each of these areas must be in constantly changing conditions, which causes many problems that require a quick solution.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-1024x574.webp" alt="Solar farm field with solar panels and different buildings" class="wp-image-3826" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-1024x574.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-768x430.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-1536x861.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-2048x1148.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-512x287.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-920x516.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-1600x897.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-1920x1076.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">With the help of IoT technologies, we can take indicators that the analytics system can later store, process, and convert into previously unattainable parameters.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-the-difficulty-of-solving-challenges">Understanding the difficulty of solving challenges</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Before identifying the main challenges, it is important to understand their complexity and difficulty. We have identified 3 main causes for the decrease in overall efficiency:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The first</strong>&nbsp;is the large number of important metrics that need to be collected for analysis. A solar farm consists of hundreds or even thousands of devices. Each of the devices has a bunch of different parameters that are important for monitoring efficiency. No matter how much we reduce and simplify the system, even a 5 MWh system will have over 10,000 panels. The panels are connected to many inverters and batteries. And they, in turn, are connected by many connections. Accordingly, the system contains a huge amount of data, which is important to operate within a pile.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The second</strong>&nbsp;is the instability of parameters due to changing weather conditions and the sensitivity of solar panels to external factors. This makes it impossible to identify patterns and set simple thresholds. A 15% drop in energy production may be due to a passing cloud rather than a breakdown, soiling, or misconfiguration. With parameters constantly shifting, spotting true problems becomes near impossible for standard threshold-based monitoring tools.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The third</strong>&nbsp;is the inability of humans to process large amounts of data in real-time to take action to improve the situation. But quick action is essential to maximize productivity. So, the system requires machine intervention when it comes to large arrays of constantly changing indicators.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">However, a mature advanced analytics system contains built-in instruments that can help us solve the challenges described. Here are a few of them:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="561" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1024x561.webp" alt="Circulation of solar farm building challenges" class="wp-image-3828" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1024x561.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-300x164.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-768x421.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1536x842.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-2048x1122.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-512x281.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-920x504.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1600x877.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1920x1052.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">So, advanced analytics can work with large amounts of data, find unusual patterns within it, and make the necessary decisions independently to achieve maximum efficiency.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Now that we understand the complexity of overcoming challenges and the tools that help solve them, we can proceed with a detailed overview of each challenge and possible solutions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-main-challenges-in-solar-farms">The main challenges in solar farms</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="operational-and-maintenance-costs">Operational and Maintenance Costs</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">One of the main challenges solar power plant owners face is the significant operation and maintenance costs associated with maintaining these facilities. The main reasons for high expenses are:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Replacement or maintenance of faulty components</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Panel cleaning</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Equipment wear and tear</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Labor costs</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar panels are sensitive to many environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, dust in the air, and other environmental indicators that accumulate over time. Not only do they reduce energy production efficiency, but they also require frequent maintenance and cleaning, which increases overall operating costs.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Here are the most common issues with solar plants that accumulate over time: Delamination and Internal Corrosion, Electrical Issues, Hot Spots, PID Effect, Snail Trail Contamination, Overheating, Isolation Short-Circuit Fault, Inverter Does Not Restart, and MPPT.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">If you want to learn more about this topic, see a full description of the problems and their solutions using anomaly detection, and check out the detailed step-by-step&nbsp;<a href="/blog/optimizing-solar-parks-efficiency-advanced-anomaly-detection-solutions/">guide here</a>.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Expenses such as these can account for up to 15-20% of the total annual cost of solar generation. Traditional maintenance practices often follow a fixed schedule, leading to inefficiencies, unnecessary downtime, and excessive operating costs.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar plant managers can use predictive analytics to foresee potential problems before they become costly downtime. This proactive approach minimizes the need for reactive or scheduled maintenance, optimizing the efficiency of the solar plant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="soiling">Soiling</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The accumulation of dust, dirt, grime, snow, sand deposits, and bird droppings on solar panels blocks incident sunlight to the cells and is a prime source of efficiency losses for solar farms.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Manual cleaning of soiled panels to restore generation is laborious and costly and only offers temporary respite against recurring soiling triggered by environmental or seasonal weather. The high frequency of cleaning needed for farms in specific locales also exponentially increases associated water usage and labor costs. Furthermore, traditional visual inspections for contamination suffer from inaccuracy due to limited manpower and subjective assessments that tend to underestimate early contamination.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Research shows soiling alone can lead to a staggering 7-30% decline in power generation for farms in deserts, near farms, highways, or colder regions. For instance, in some parts of the United States, the soiling rate can range from 0.03 to 0.15% per day, while in desert environments, the soiling loss can be as high as 0.5% per day. These generation gaps for solar farms with tens of thousands of panels placed in arrays covering different geographical regions lead to multimillion-dollar losses.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The way to solve soiling on solar farms with advanced analytics is to use forecasting and comprehensive calculation of the costs of soiling. By finding the perfect balance between the cost of cleaning and the prediction of pollution losses, the system based on real-time data can create a cost-effective cleaning schedule for specific areas.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">The system can provide a comprehensive report based on actual data, offering an overview of the solar farm’s condition and details about the optimal time for cleaning the solar panels. Additionally, the system can control the activation and deactivation of the nozzles or any other automated cleaning system at the most suitable time.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">If you want to learn more about the topic, check out the detailed step-by-step guide covering the topic of “Soiling” in Solar Farms. To read it,&nbsp;<a href="/blog/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-by-optimizing-the-cleaning-process/">click here</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="performance-degradation-over-time">Performance degradation over time</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Another problem faced by solar power plant owners is the progressive degradation of generating capacity over the lifetime of a plant, which spans decades.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The long-term impact of natural factors, such as solar radiation, moisture, thermal cycles, and mechanical loads, leads to slow wear and tear of components over many years. Delamination, color change, hot spots, and microcracks in the panels lead to an annual drop in conversion efficiency and electrical output of 0.5-1%.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">For a 100 MWh solar power plant, over 25 years of operation, this steady degradation leads to a 10-20% net drop in electricity generation, which means millions in lost profits. Owners also face uncertainty in accurately predicting the degradation trajectories of equipment of different ages located at different sites. False estimates lead to revenue losses due to inaccurate power sales contracts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="643" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1024x643.webp" alt="Grid with solar farm statistics" class="wp-image-3852" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1024x643.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-300x188.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-768x482.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1536x964.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-2048x1285.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-512x321.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-920x577.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1600x1004.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1920x1205.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Moreover, solar panels do not only degrade over time. The connection elements, inverters, batteries, and performance monitoring sensors lose effectiveness over time. It should also be noted that because the equipment is open to unplanned complete failure, solar farms may require short- and medium-term replacements.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">However, at the same time, we should keep in mind that electricity generation on solar farms is unstable. Therefore, it is not possible to tell the difference between changes in weather conditions and degradation by setting thresholds or simply looking at the indicators.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Advanced analytics allows us to identify long-term and short-term degradation, thus solving this problem. In addition, understanding when the best time to reinvest in equipment replacement is an advantage that will help you maintain the highest possible return on your investment over time.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The system constantly checks indicators from many parts of the solar power plant, making it possible to track the overall condition and degradation of individual areas. Not only is it possible to calculate, but accurate degradation monitoring will help avoid revenue losses caused by unpredictable degradation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-and-intrusion-detection">Security and Intrusion Detection</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants are often located in remote locations and are large installations covering large areas. Therefore, expensive equipment such as inverters and solar panels face significant security and intrusion risks from external intruders. These risks can take many forms, causing huge financial and operational losses.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Theft and vandalism are common, with thieves attempting to steal valuable copper wiring and hackers tampering with energy infrastructure, causing power outages. Natural disasters such as forest fires, storms, and floods also create problems that threaten fencing, cables, and monitoring infrastructure. Additional risks, such as unauthorized access to control rooms or electrical sites through broken gates, also create security risks.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Without reliable monitoring tools, these threats often go undetected for long periods, allowing attackers to cause significant damage. Even traditional legacy security systems, such as motion detectors and surveillance cameras, have blind spots where cunning attackers can bypass detection. Patrolling security also offers inconsistent protection based on a large geography. The lack of real-time context also makes threat response ineffective.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Modern analytics platforms offer comprehensive coverage, analysis, and tools to protect solar power plants better. Sensor data analytics can dynamically monitor multi-factor threats. Algorithms can detect anomalies that indicate potential perimeter breaches. Smart cameras or drones can also detect intruder signals and send alerts to dispatchers faster. The information obtained from the cameras and drones can work in conjunction with other data from the solar farm, giving access to almost complete control over the security of the solar farm. Based on historical data from past interventions, you can build the best strategy to eliminate interference in the future.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="optimizing-energy-output">Optimizing Energy Output</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants face the challenge of optimizing energy production due to inconsistent access to their main fuel &#8211; sunlight. The energy output changes during the day depending on the sun’s intensity and between days depending on the changing weather conditions.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Complex factors such as cloud cover, temperature, humidity, dust, and vegetation growth also dynamically affect the irradiance falling on the panels.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Starting with potential fines for under-delivery of electricity under power purchase agreements and ending with the impossibility of profitably participating in spot electricity markets based on the fact that there is too much energy to store in batteries of the available capacity. That is why it is important to use complex calculations and forecasts to find the projected energy production for the coming days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-1024x640.webp" alt="Chart with consumption forecast" class="wp-image-3854" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-1024x640.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-300x188.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-768x480.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-1536x960.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-2048x1280.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-512x320.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-920x575.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-1600x1000.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-1920x1200.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Advanced analytics allows you to detect generation problems by detecting anomalies or forecast problems by predicting them and triggering preventive, corrective actions to eliminate them. The analytical system can also analyze on a minute-by-minute basis whether it is better to take energy from batteries, solar panels, or the system, thus optimizing electricity bills. Such an automated system can significantly reduce electricity bills for households/factories and maximize profits for solar farms.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="grid-integration-challenge">Grid Integration Challenge</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The volatility of solar generation, which is dependent on weather conditions, creates significant challenges for grid integration. Solar energy production changes rapidly depending on cloud cover and time of day, causing voltage and frequency fluctuations for utilities if not appropriately handled. For grids with a high penetration of solar facilities, this variable generation, if increased, can challenge the stability and reliability of the grid.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">There are 3 types of system connection to the grid: distributed systems (off-grid), centralized energy (on-grid), and hybrid systems.</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Distributed generation is small solar photovoltaic panels (usually from 5 to 500 kilowatts) installed on residential or commercial properties, and solar panels satisfy the main demand for electricity.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Centralized generation is large centralized solar parks, usually with a capacity of hundreds of megawatts, which are connected to the power grid via high-voltage power lines. The main difference between off-grid and on-grid systems is that in centralized power generation, all the energy produced goes from the panels to an inverter, which is converted into alternating current and sent almost directly to the utility grid. In a distributed generation, the energy is stored in batteries and used by a residential or commercial facility as needed.</li>

<p style="font-size:16px">Problems such as voltage spikes, protection discoordination, phase distortion, and unexpected voltage drops can occur when solar power exhibits instability and unpredictability.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Without effective climate change adaptation, problems range from nuisances like flickering lights to catastrophic large-scale blackouts due to cascading power line failures. The economic costs of unreliable renewable generation also reduce investor confidence in further expanding solar power to meet decarbonization goals.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Predictive forecasting combined with optimization for unexpected situations provides actionable information about the future variability of solar generation. Grid operators can take proactive steps to redirect generators, limit the capacity of solar power plants, or deploy batteries to smooth out fluctuations. Real-time anomaly detection also continuously monitors any new equipment limitations or stability risks.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Optimized algorithms prescribe ideal storage vs generation decisions hourly when combined with predictive modeling of dynamic electricity spot prices. Over a year, farms have achieved as much as 5-7% upside in annual revenues besides minimizing deviation penalties.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="first-steps-to-solving-problems">First steps to solving problems</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">We realized which problems occur in solar panels. We understood how to solve them with the help of advanced analytics. So finally, let’s define an action plan on how to make it happen with the help of the ThingsBoard IoT platform and Trendz for advanced analytics:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Collect data from the solar farm site into an IoT platform for processing. Most equipment is capable of&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/integrations/">reporting data using Modbus, MQTT, HTTP protocols</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/">gateway data loggers</a>. We need to collect the following information: 
<ul>
<li>Data from weather stations &#8211; solar irradiance, temperature, humidity, etc</li>



<li>Metrics from Inverters &#8211; input and output voltage, current, frequency, etc.</li>



<li>Metrics from solar panels or Strings &#8211; voltage, operating time, panel temperature, panel orientation, etc.</li>



<li>Metrics from batteries or energy storage systems &#8211; voltage and current, state of charge, temperature, etc.</li>



<li>Information from energy meters and grid &#8211; real-time energy flow, power quality data, grid demand response, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Set up a monitoring dashboard in the IoT platform that will&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/dashboards/">visualize collected data in real-time</a>.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/trendz/calculated-fields/">Configure computation of </a><a href="https://10.7.3.196:4000/docs/trendz/calculated-fields/">system-level metrics / KPIs</a>&nbsp;that would describe overall system behavior.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/trendz/anomaly/anomaly-detection-overview/">Train anomaly detection model on historical data</a>&nbsp;to identify abnormal component behavior or equipment misconfiguration. Enable real-time anomaly detection for all on-site equipment.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/trendz/guide/predict-next-maintenance-date-of-equipment/">Configure predictive maintenance models</a>&nbsp;that would forecast potential issues in the future and compute equipment health scores.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/alarms/">Set up Alerting and notification rules</a>&nbsp;to trigger automated corrective actions or&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/">notify staff about discovered incidents</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar farms, due to their design factor, have a large number of challenges that require constant intervention and monitoring of the overall condition of the farm. The main challenges are operating and maintenance costs, soiling, performance degradation over time, security and intrusion detection, optimizing energy output, and grid integration challenges.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Effectively handling these challenges is the basis for the high efficiency of a solar farm.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">However, manual reading of indicators or setting thresholds is not enough for power plants with unstable energy production. Using advanced analytics will open up new horizons of efficiency and reliability for your solar farm. The future looks bright for the partnership between solar and advanced analytics!</p>

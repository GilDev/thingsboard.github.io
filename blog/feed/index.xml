<p>We have added support for sending push notifications to mobile applications. Transform your mobile app&#8217;s communication with our enhanced push notifications feature. This feature allows users to receive immediate alerts and notifications directly on their mobile devices, ensuring they are promptly informed about critical events, status updates, or any anomalies detected within their IoT ecosystem. Learn more about push notifications in <a href="/blog/push-notifications-to-thingsboard-mobile-apps/" data-type="page" data-id="3907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this post</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New chart widgets</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2406" height="1290" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-3931" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_.webp 2406w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_-300x161.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_-1024x549.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_-768x412.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_-1536x824.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_-2048x1098.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_-512x275.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_-920x493.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_-1600x858.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chart-widgets_-1920x1029.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re excited to introduce a suite of advanced visualization widgets powered by <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html">Apache ECharts</a> to enhance your data analysis and presentation capabilities. This includes the new <strong>Time Series </strong>chart that now may combine lines and bars on the same widget. We have also added two new <strong>Bar </strong>charts to display data via bars with or without labels. Our priority was not only to deliver powerful and pretty charts but also to simplify the widget configuration experience. We hope you enjoy new data visualization capabilities! Learn more about new time-series chart widgets in <a href="/blog/enhancing-iot-data-visualization-introducing-new-time-series-charts/" data-type="page" data-id="3907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this post</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New grouping intervals: Week (Sun-Sat), Week (Mon-Sun), Month, Quarter</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2406" height="1773" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1.webp" alt="Form with seven options which configure grouping intervals for dashboard time window " class="wp-image-3793" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1.webp 2406w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-300x221.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1024x755.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-768x566.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1536x1132.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-2048x1509.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-512x377.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-920x678.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1600x1179.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1920x1415.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<p>The update introduces new grouping intervals for dashboard <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time window</a> configurations: <strong>Week (Sun-Sat)</strong>, <strong>Week (Mon-Sun)</strong>, <strong>Month</strong>, and <strong>Quarter</strong>. The intervals adjust to the browser&#8217;s time zone by default, but there&#8217;s also the option to set a custom time zone for further customization. These additions allow for more flexible and granular data visualization and analysis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Button widgets</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="263" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets.webp" alt="Five blocks with icons and text" class="wp-image-3794" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets.webp 802w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-300x98.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-768x252.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-512x168.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve improved our platform with the new button widgets: the <strong>Action Button</strong> <strong>widget </strong>for navigation to other dashboards, states, or custom actions; the <strong>Command Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for sending commands to devices, updating attributes, or appending time-series data; the <strong>Toggle Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for switching between two device states; the <strong>Power Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for toggling the device on and off. Each widget is designed to offer users more control and interactivity within the platform, improving the overall experience. Explore the full potential of the new button widgets in the dedicated <a href="/blog/iot-widgets-for-enhanced-dashboards-introducing-the-action-command-toggle-and-power-buttons/" data-type="link" data-id="https://wp.thingsboard.io/iot-widgets-for-enhanced-dashboards-introducing-the-action-command-toggle-and-power-buttons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Control widgets</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="305" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets.webp" alt="Three blocks with toggle button and one with slider" class="wp-image-3795" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets.webp 802w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-300x114.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-768x292.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-512x195.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re introducing Control widgets: the <strong>Slider Widget</strong> and the <strong>Toggle Button Widget</strong>. Both widgets have a simple configuration interface and allow users to trigger commands to devices, update attributes, or append time-series data for the target entity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Alarm comment support for edge instances</h2>



<p>This feature enables bidirectional synchronization of comments on alarms between edge and cloud instances. With this update, users can seamlessly add comments to alarms directly within the Edge environment, and these comments are synchronized with the ThingsBoard cloud instance in real time, ensuring consistency and transparency throughout the entire system. Additionally, comments added or modified in the cloud instance are automatically propagated to the Edge environment, ensuring that all operators have access to the latest information regardless of their location or the system they are using.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Now, you can receive instant alerts and updates directly on your smartphone, making it easier than ever to stay connected with your IoT devices. Whether you&#8217;re monitoring temperature changes, tracking device status, or just want to stay informed, our new push notifications ensure you&#8217;re always in the loop. Get ready to elevate your IoT experience with real-time alerts wherever you are.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Firebase setup</h4>



<p>To deliver notifications from ThingsBoard instances to mobile apps, we utilize <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firebase</a>. To set up push notifications, create a Firebase project and provide the necessary Firebase credentials to both the platform instance and the mobile application. For setup instructions, community edition users should follow this community edition <a href="/docs/mobile/getting-started/#step-4-optional-configure-push-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>, while professional edition users can refer to the professional edition <a href="/docs/pe/mobile/getting-started/#step-4-optional-configure-push-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to Use Notifications</h4>



<p>After setting up the platform and your app, you can start using the notification center to send out alerts. You can do this in two ways: manually or automatically with notification rules.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Sending Notifications Manually</h5>



<p>Open the &#8220;New notification&#8221; wizard by following this <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#send-notification">guide</a>. Specify target recipients and choose &#8220;Mobile app&#8221; as the method for sending your notification. Please note that the recipient must install and login to the mobile application before the notifications may be sent. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1920" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit rule settings form with eight fields" class="wp-image-3870" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1.webp 2409w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-300x239.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1024x816.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-768x612.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1536x1224.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-2048x1632.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-512x408.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-920x733.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1600x1275.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1920x1530.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>In the next step, you&#8217;ll be able to personalize your notification. This includes choosing a subject, writing the message, and picking a custom icon to appear in the mobile app&#8217;s notification section.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="2070" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard new notification settings form with four fields" class="wp-image-3871" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1.webp 2409w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-300x258.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1024x880.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-768x660.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1536x1320.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-2048x1760.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-512x440.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-920x791.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1600x1375.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1920x1650.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>Notifications can do more than just inform; they can also take users somewhere specific. There are two options for what happens when someone taps on a notification:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Open URL:</strong> This can be any link, inside or outside the app. For internal links, you can direct users to pages like home, alarms, devices, assets, or customers by using these shortcuts: <code>/home</code>,<code> /alarms</code>, <code>/devices</code>, <code>/assets</code>,<code> /customers</code>, <code>/auditLogs</code>.</li>



<li><strong>Open Dashboard:</strong> This option works just like it does for web notifications, taking the user directly to a specific dashboard.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you don&#8217;t set up a tap action, tapping the notification will bring up the notifications page by default.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="880" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1024x880.webp" alt="Smartphone with thingsboard notifications on the screen" class="wp-image-3872" style="width:801px;height:auto" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1024x880.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-300x258.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-768x660.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1536x1320.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-2048x1760.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-512x440.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-920x791.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1600x1375.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1920x1650.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Notification Rules</h5>



<p>Notification rules are your go-to tool for automating alerts based on specific events, making it a breeze to keep everyone informed without manual intervention. A common scenario is sending out alerts for new alarms. These rules can handle everything from simple notifications to complex escalation chains and are highly customizable. Learn more about notification rules <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#alarm-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. See the default rule below. This rule sends information about new alarm to all tenant administrators:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="2466" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit rule settings form with six fields" class="wp-image-3873" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1.webp 2409w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-293x300.webp 293w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1000x1024.webp 1000w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-768x786.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1500x1536.webp 1500w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-2001x2048.webp 2001w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-512x524.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1024x1048.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-920x942.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1600x1638.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1920x1965.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>Each rule is associated with a notification <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#templates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">template</a>, which defines the delivery method and appearance of notifications. To get started with push notifications for new alarms, modify the &#8220;New Alarm Notification&#8221; template to include the &#8220;Mobile app&#8221; delivery option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1977" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit notification template settings form with eight fields" class="wp-image-3874" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1.webp 2409w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-300x246.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1024x840.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-768x630.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1536x1261.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-2048x1681.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-512x420.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-920x755.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1600x1313.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1920x1576.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>You can either reuse the message and subject from web notification or create your own. To make your notifications more engaging and relevant, use dynamic content like <code>alarmType</code> and <code>alarmOriginatorName</code>. A full list of available parameters can be found in the built-in documentation.</p>

<p>After setting up your notification templates, you&#8217;re all set to see them in action without the need for any extra setup. For instance, by using the already available <code>Air Quality Monitoring</code> solution template, you can immediately start receiving notifications triggered by the predefined alarms in this solution. This approach lets you quickly validate your notification settings and ensure everything works seamlessly right out of the gate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br>Since launching, our time-series charts have grown a lot but have become harder to configure due to many new features. We decided to make them easier to use and added advanced data zoom capabilities by switching to <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://echarts.apache.org/">Apache ECharts</a>, a popular and powerful charting tool. Below, we&#8217;ll walk through the new widget setup and spotlight the latest enhancements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Time series chart family</h4>



<p>Our new chart family includes four types. The main one, the <strong>time series</strong> chart, lets you show lines, bars, and points all at once. The others are <strong>line</strong>, <strong>bar</strong>, and <strong>point</strong> charts. We&#8217;ll focus on the basic configuration of the time series chart below. The other charts&#8217; configurations and features are very similar.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Time window and data source</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#widget-time-window" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time window</a> and <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#data-source-types" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#data-source-types">data source</a> configurations are similar to other time series widgets. Please note that you may display data from multiple entities using <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entity aliases</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="412" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1024x412.webp" alt="Thingsboard time window and data source configurations" class="wp-image-3749" style="width:798px;height:auto" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1024x412.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-300x121.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-768x309.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1536x618.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-2048x824.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-512x206.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-920x370.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1600x644.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1920x772.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Y axes</h4>



<p>New charts differ from the old ones by offering direct control over the Y-axes setup, influencing how these axes are shown visually. Each chart comes with a <strong>default</strong> Y axis that is fixed and cannot be removed. Initially, any new series or threshold you add will appear on this default axis. However, you have the option to create additional axes and specify these for your new series or thresholds during their configuration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="404" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1024x404.webp" alt="Thingsboard Y-axes setup with default configuration" class="wp-image-3728" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1024x404.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-300x118.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-768x303.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1536x606.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-2048x808.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-512x202.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-920x363.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1600x632.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1920x758.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Configurable options for each axis include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Option to toggle the axis visibility. Even if hidden, it affects the chart if min or max values are set.</li>



<li>An optional label for the axis.</li>



<li>Choice of axis placement: left or right side of the chart.</li>



<li>Minimum and maximum values to set the chart&#8217;s visual range. Leaving these empty enables automatic adjustment based on data values.</li>



<li>Units for the values are displayed next to the axis.</li>



<li>The number of decimal places for value precision.</li>



<li>Selection between line or bar for the axis representation.</li>



<li>Additional settings to adjust the appearance of axis ticks and lines.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Series</h4>



<p>The series table lets you set up which time series data keys to show. You can display each series as either a line or bars, and it needs to be linked to a specific Y-axis. When displaying data from several entities together, you can use <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entity aliases</a> as the data source. To differentiate between data series from various entities, we recommend including <strong>${entityName} </strong>or <strong>${entityLabel}</strong> in the series label. These placeholders will automatically be replaced with the specific names or labels of the entities, making it easier to tell the series apart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="409" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1024x409.webp" alt="Thingsboard series table with default config" class="wp-image-3729" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1024x409.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-300x120.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-768x307.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1536x614.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-2048x819.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-512x205.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-920x368.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1600x640.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1920x768.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Configurable options for each series include:</p>



<ul>
<li>A label for the series. Supports <code>${entityName}</code> or <code>${entityLabel}</code> template parameters.</li>



<li>The display style: choose between a line or a bar.</li>



<li>The color for the line, bar, or points.</li>



<li>Units that are displayed next to the value in tooltips.</li>



<li>The number of decimal places for value precision.</li>



<li>Additional settings for managing the series&#8217; appearance in the legend and other visual aspects.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Thresholds</h4>



<p>Threshold settings have been incorporated into the basic widget configurations, maintaining their full functionality while simplifying the process. There are three ways to set thresholds:</p>



<ul>
<li>Using a constant value for simplicity.</li>



<li>Referencing an attribute from the entity specified in the data source.</li>



<li>Referencing an attribute from a different entity, such as an asset, customer, or tenant, offers flexibility in threshold configuration.</li>
</ul>



<p>Find examples of these configuration options in the screenshot provided below.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Data zoom</h4>



<p>A valuable new enhancement is the introduction of data zoom functionality. This feature enables you to zoom into specific data points or ranges directly within your browser, efficiently and without the need for additional data requests from the server.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="418" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1024x418.webp" alt="Long chart with three lines and data zoom option" class="wp-image-3824" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1024x418.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-300x123.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-768x314.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1536x627.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-2048x837.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-512x209.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-920x376.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1600x654.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1920x784.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tooltip improvement</h4>



<p>The tooltip configuration has been updated to offer more flexibility in formatting data and showing the data&#8217;s time interval. By default, the tooltip will show both the start and end times of the data aggregation period. You now have the option to customize the font and colors for both the actual values and the date labels, as well as the tooltip&#8217;s background, to suit your preferences.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="634" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Tooltip-improvement_1-1024x634.webp" alt="Chart which is showing bars and lines

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other EChart-based widgets</h4>



<p>We have added a few more widgets with slightly different configurations.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Bar chart with labels</h5>



<p>The widget is crafted to compare aggregated data across various entities or multiple data keys. To differentiate between data from different entities, incorporate <code>${entityName}</code> or <code>${entityLabel}</code> into the series label.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">Ensuring reliable and consistent monitoring of temperature and humidity is crucial for the proper storage of temperature-sensitive medications and perishable food products. Our partner, <a href="https://www.vypin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vypin</a>, has successfully deployed WhereView, a solution powered by ThingsBoard, for a leading global pharmaceutical corporation. This IoT application has significantly enhanced operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</p>



<div style="height:16px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="803" height="451" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp" alt="Working conditions on the left side and device on the right side" class="wp-image-3797" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp 803w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-300x168.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-768x431.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-512x288.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The challenge</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposes stringent guidelines on pharmaceutical manufacturers concerning storage conditions and the regulatory compliance of control systems. The client approached Vypin with a request to overhaul their existing system, which failed to meet FDA standards, leading to penalties and the potential for product or ingredient spoilage.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The client&#8217;s primary concerns revolved around data loss. The then-existing devices were prone to disconnections due to various issues, such as network or power failures, leading to lapses in telemetry transmission or recording. Furthermore, the system lacked a mechanism for notifying the client about these disruptions. Additionally, there was no provision for remote access to monitoring data.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="is-style-cs-about" style="font-size:16px">Round-the-clock rotation of operators to control the temperature and humidity in the warehouse indeed is not the best solution. Therefore, in the regular automatic reports related to the storage environment state there were gaps in the tables and graphs. The FDA fines for such violations.</p>
<cite>Customer officer says</cite></blockquote>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">The solution</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">In response, Vypin proposed the Vypin-WhereView system, leveraging ThingsBoard&#8217;s capabilities. The solution involved establishing a wireless network, along with the installation of sensors and gateways.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Addressing the initial concern of data loss, the newly installed sensors were equipped with memory modules to store telemetry data locally. Thus, even in the event of a gateway disconnection, data integrity was maintained. Upon restoration of the gateway&#8217;s online status, it would retrieve and transmit the stored telemetry to WhereView.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="893" height="407" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923.webp" alt="Screen with opened dashboard and devices in front" class="wp-image-3800" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923.webp 893w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923-300x137.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923-768x350.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923-512x233.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The WareView application, powered by ThingsBoard, resolved the outstanding concerns of reliable data processing and storage and enabled differentiated access levels. Designated personnel were granted comprehensive access, allowing them to monitor data from all warehouses at any time and location. In contrast, warehouse managers were provided with tailored access rights, enabling them to oversee only their specific warehouses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="803" height="460" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6.webp" alt="Two windows with alarms information  and dashboard" class="wp-image-3799" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6.webp 803w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-300x172.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-768x440.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-512x293.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Accessing the dashboard, which displays various graphs and tables, simply requires logging into the system from a web browser.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">A noteworthy feature is the customized notification system, established through ThingsBoard&#8217;s rule engine and device profiles. This system alerts the relevant individuals in case of deviations from preset conditions, such as temperature threshold breaches. This feature facilitates immediate response and the implementation of preventive measures.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">The outcome</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Prevention is universally acknowledged as more efficient, cost-effective, and less time-consuming than cure. With the newly installed warehouse monitoring system, the client now has the capability to proactively prevent issues before they arise, ensuring the safety and integrity of their sensitive products.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">This case study exemplifies the power of IoT in enhancing regulatory compliance and operational efficiency in critical industries such as pharmaceuticals. The Vypin-WhereView solution, backed by ThingsBoard, demonstrates our commitment to delivering innovative and reliable monitoring solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">Welcome to the latest update from the ThingsBoard team! Our ongoing mission to improve the platform&#8217;s functionality and user experience brings us to the introduction of four innovative IoT widgets: the &#8220;Action button,&#8221; &#8220;Command button,&#8221; &#8220;Toggle button,&#8221; and &#8220;Power button.&#8221; Designed with a focus on usability, these new buttons are tailored for the most common IoT use cases, offering users enhanced control and flexibility in managing their IoT devices and dashboards. Let&#8217;s dive into their capabilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Action button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">This button facilitates single-click navigation to other dashboards, states, or custom actions. You may choose one of the common <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions">widget actions</a> to be triggered when the user clicks the button. You may also choose whether the button is in default, activated, or disabled state. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2406" height="441" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons.webp" alt="Tree buttons with different clicking states " class="wp-image-3716" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons.webp 2406w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-300x55.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1024x188.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-768x141.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1536x282.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-2048x375.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-512x94.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-920x169.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1600x293.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1920x352.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">More importantly, the button may dynamically change its state based on the value of the attribute or time-series subscription. You may find an example of the button that changes its state when the user attribute is updated below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-2b8b2412-a70d-486d-bfd5-d21e65230e9a" href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tb-dynamic_button_states.json">tb_dynamic_button_states.json</a><a href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tb-dynamic_button_states.json" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-2b8b2412-a70d-486d-bfd5-d21e65230e9a">Download</a></div>



<p style="font-size:16px">The behavior configuration is available in the basic widget settings:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1353" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2.webp" alt="Thingsboard basic widget settings" class="wp-image-3718" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2.webp 2409w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-300x168.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1024x575.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-768x431.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1536x863.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-2048x1150.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-512x288.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-920x517.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1600x899.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1920x1078.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The button appearance is highly customizable. You may choose one of four available layouts, configure icons, and label appearance. The colors of the buttons are configured via main and background color palettes. By default, the button uses a palette configured in the <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/white-labeling/">white-labeling settings</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1626" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-3899" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1.webp 2409w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-300x202.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1024x691.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-768x518.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1536x1037.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-2048x1382.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-512x346.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-920x621.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1600x1080.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1920x1296.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Although the button supports all common <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions">widget actions</a>, we will highlight only the most popular in this article. To demonstrate them, we have prepared the dashboard that you may <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#import-dashboard">import</a> to your platform instance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1353" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases.webp" alt="Thingsboard dashboard with five blocks which are demonstrating widget actions capabilities " class="wp-image-3722" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases.webp 2409w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-300x168.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1024x575.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-768x431.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1536x863.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-2048x1150.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-512x288.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-920x517.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1600x899.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1920x1078.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">You may find the sample dashboard JSON below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-fd741ad2-e692-4a03-9a23-812a9f191991" href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/button_use_cases.json">button_use_cases.json</a></div>



<p style="font-size:16px">The dashboard has two states: &#8220;default&#8221; and &#8220;other&#8221;. The default state contains 5 showcase buttons. The &#8220;other&#8221; state contains a line chart widget with random data. Let&#8217;s review each button below:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open dialog</strong> button uses &#8220;Navigate to new dashboard state&#8221; with the &#8220;Open in separate dialog&#8221; display option. So, the user will see the line chart opened in a modal window.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="372" data-id="3566" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Open_dialog-2.gif" alt="Opening dialog which shows chart" class="wp-image-3566"/></figure>
</figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open popup</strong> button is similar, but the &#8220;Open in popover&#8221; display option is used. You may also explore various options for the &#8220;Preferred popover placement&#8221; option. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="372" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Open_pop-up-1.gif" alt="Opening popup which shows chart" class="wp-image-3567" style="width:802px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Change state</strong> button simply update the current dashboard state to the new one. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="372" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Change_state.gif" alt="Opening another dashboard state after clicking on the button" class="wp-image-3570"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Drill down</strong> button is similar, but instead of changing the dashboard state, it leaves the old one in the stack. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="372" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Drill_down.gif" alt="Opening another dashboard state with leaving the old one in the stack after clicking on the button " class="wp-image-3571"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open URL</strong> provides the ability to open external or relative URLs in the same or separate browser tab. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="372" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Open_url.gif" alt="Opening google after clicking on the button" class="wp-image-3572"/></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Command button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Command button widget is designed to perform three key actions: sending <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rpc/">commands</a> to devices, updating <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/attributes/">attributes</a>, or appending <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/telemetry/">time-series</a> data. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">You can specify a single device to carry out your chosen action, such as receiving a command. For those familiar with the platform, there&#8217;s an option to use <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/">entity aliases</a> for targeting. This means you&#8217;re not limited to devices; you can target assets, users, or other entities capable of supporting attribute updates or time-series data additions. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Behavior settings enable the definition of the on-click action and condition when the button is disabled. More importantly, the button may dynamically become enabled or disabled based on attribute or time-series subscription. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Execute RPC action</strong> allows you to send the command to the device. You may configure the command (method) name and parameters of the command.

<p style="font-size:16px">You may dynamically disable the button based on certain values of the attribute or time-series key. For example, the dashboard attached below contains two buttons that switch the state of the user&#8217;s attribute &#8220;state&#8221;. When the user presses button A, it becomes disabled, and vice versa.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">Alternatively, you may disable the button that sends the command to the device, if the device is offline. For this purpose, you may just use the value of the &#8220;active&#8221; attribute or time-series key. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The appearance settings for the Command button are identical to those of the Action button. The primary applications of the Command button are straightforward, focusing on managing devices and assets. This involves either issuing commands or updating attributes to control their operation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Toggle button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Toggle button widget shares many similarities with the Command button widget, but with a crucial distinction: it features two distinct states, &#8220;checked&#8221; and &#8220;unchecked&#8221;. This design allows it to perform two specific actions, &#8220;Check&#8221; and &#8220;Uncheck&#8221;, depending on its state. Users have the flexibility to fully customize the appearance of the button for both states, enhancing its visual and functional integration into their dashboards.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Power button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Power button widget, similar to the Toggle button, differs in appearance and has three states: &#8216;On&#8217;, &#8216;Off&#8217; and disabled, with six customizable layouts:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1606" height="608" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Power-button-widget.webp" alt="Grid with power buttons in on or off state" class="wp-image-3770" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Power-button-widget.webp 1606w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Power-button-widget-300x114.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Power-button-widget-1024x388.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Power-button-widget-768x291.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Power-button-widget-1536x581.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Power-button-widget-512x194.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Power-button-widget-920x348.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Power-button-widget-1600x606.webp 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1606px) 100vw, 1606px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The appearance settings are simplified compared to the Command button. Basically, you are able to configure main and background colors for every state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction&nbsp;</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Equipment in production plays an important role in achieving maximum efficiency, quality, and payback. The issues that are key to optimizing the use of equipment are:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Underutilization of Equipment</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Ineffective Production Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Excessive Wear and Tear on Machinery</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Operational Bottlenecks</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Misaligned Capacity Planning</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solving these problems requires constant monitoring of equipment utilization and performance metrics. As production output increases, manufacturers may need to partially or completely change their equipment maintenance strategies and schedules to maintain efficiency. Unfortunately, these problems cannot be solved once and for all. But it also means that we can endlessly improve the optimization process.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">That is why having the most up-to-date data is important when choosing an optimization strategy. Previously, with the help of logging, you could see how the equipment worked at the end of the day or week. With the growth of technology and the help of IoT devices, we can receive raw data in real-time. With advanced analytics, you can turn raw data into meaningful reports and predict future equipment behavior using machine learning models.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equipment Utilization</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">To understand the overall condition of the equipment, you need to operate with a significant number of KPIs. We have divided KPIs by the problems they solve:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Underutilization of Equipment and Operational Bottlenecks</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Production Output &#8211; A numerical or quality indicator of the useful action performed by the equipment. The information is collected using counters, scales, or quality sensors transmitted via the network to the ThingsBoard. The data does not require any additional processing.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:16px">Based on the indicators, this method helps to track production and has more opportunities to react proactively or to problems. Thus, the use of advanced analytics gives us access to:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Maximizing Efficiency:</strong> Companies can identify underused resources by measuring how much equipment is used compared to its full potential. This helps make adjustments to increase efficiency, ensuring that the equipment is not just sitting idle when it could contribute to production.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Equipment represents a significant investment for any business. Measuring its utilization helps understand whether the company is getting the most out of this investment.

					<description><![CDATA[Solar power plants face issues due to temperature and environmental factors, which lead to reduced efficiency and potential&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants face issues due to temperature and environmental factors, which lead to reduced efficiency and potential major breakdowns if not addressed quickly. The challenge is that monitoring tools like drones, digital multimeters, and infrared cameras are costly, making regular checks infrequent, which does not allow quick responses to problems. This means that if a problem arises after a maintenance check, electricity production efficiency will fall, leading to significant losses.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The ability to quickly respond to problems</strong>&nbsp;is what plants with constant energy production need.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">One of the ways to achieve a quick response to problems is through the use of anomaly detection. Using this method provides an opportunity to respond to problems quickly and significantly reduces the spending on third-party equipment.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">Anomaly detection is a technique to identify patterns or events deviating from the norm. In the context of a solar farm, this can involve monitoring various factors, such as Real-time Energy Output, Power Generation Trends, Solar Irradiance, and Temperature for Solar Panels. Also Output Voltage and Current, Frequency, Efficiency, Temperature for Inverter. By analyzing this data, anomaly detection algorithms can identify unusual patterns or events that may indicate problems before they can do any damage to the solar panel or inverter. In other words, we look for a problem not when we see that energy is produced less than expected for the second day in a row but right at the moment when the problem appeared.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">But, unusual patterns are not just deviations of parameters from the norm.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Unusual patterns are combinations of parameters that are not expected but which identify potential problems. They are discovered by analyzing historical data collected from solar panels and inverters. During this analysis, we focus not only on individual parameter values but on a combination of values because it potentially gives more insights into system behavior. Based on this, it is possible to find current problems and predict future ones.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">A person cannot cope with the calculations of such data arrays. That is why we need advanced analytics with machine learning capabilities to analyze historical data and find unusual patterns in real-time.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Now, we will show how to configure Trends Analytics for correct anomaly detection. However, before that, let’s consider what types of anomalies occur in Solar Farms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="overview-of-common-anomalies-in-equipment-of-solar-power-plants">Overview of common anomalies in the equipment of solar power plants</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The most widespread and important problems for us are those with solar panels and inverters since these are the first frontier of obtaining energy. Therefore, we will look for anomalies in these parts of the power plant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="anomalies-in-photovoltaic-modules">Anomalies in photovoltaic modules</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Below, the most common breakdowns in PV modules and solar panels, which can be quickly and economically solved if they are dealt with immediately, will be described.<br><br>Most of them are formed on separate panels, so a drop in the indicators of one panel in contrast to another will indicate a breakdown. You can find each of them by finding anomalies in the Output Electricity (voltage and current) and Power Production indicators from the solar panel.</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Soiling:</strong> Soiling refers to the accumulation of dirt, dust, bird droppings, or other materials on the surface of solar panels. This layer of grime can significantly reduce the panels’ ability to absorb sunlight, leading to decreased electricity production.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Shading:</strong>&nbsp;Shading occurs when an object, such as a tree, building, or another solar panel, casts a shadow on a solar panel. This can lead to a reduction in the panel’s electricity production. Prolonged shadowing can lead to an imbalance in the solar panel system and may cause hot spots or reduce the overall lifespan of the panel.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Delamination and Internal Corrosion:</strong>&nbsp;Moisture can find its way into the panel, causing internal corrosion, if the panels are not keeping out air and water and all the solar panel components are not laminated correctly.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Identifying and Addressing Solar Panel Anomalies Faulty wiring, loose connections, corrosion, and oxidation can interfere with electricity production.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Hot Spots:</strong>&nbsp;Badly-soldered connections can cause low resistance in the part of the panel that receives the power generated by the cell, leading to a hotspot in the soldered points and/or a cell. This phenomenon can ultimately lead to a short circuit, reducing the performance and lifespan of the PV panel.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>PID Effect:</strong>&nbsp;Potential-induced degradation (PID) can cause an ongoing reduction in performance and accelerated aging of the PV panel. PID occurs when the voltage potential between the solar cells and the grounded frame of the panel causes a leakage current that can damage the cells.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Snail Trail Contamination:</strong>&nbsp;Snail trail contamination is a phenomenon where a white or grayish residue appears on the surface of the solar panel. This residue can reduce the performance of the panel and is caused by the release of silicone from the panel’s encapsulant material.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="tackling-anomalies-in-inverters">Tackling Anomalies in Inverters</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Inverters are a very important link of a solar power plant, a breakdown of which can lead to the shutdown of the entire power plant. This can have a critical impact on the total efficiency and profitability of the power plant.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">You can observe the operation of the inverter by following the indicators Output Voltage and Current, Frequency, Efficiency, and Temperature.</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Overheating:</strong>&nbsp;Inverters are sensitive to temperature, and high temperatures can reduce production and potentially a stoppage altogether if overheating occurs as the maximum operating temperature is reached. To prevent overheating, it is important to keep the switch cabinet and the area where the inverter is located well-ventilated, along with the inclusion of cleaning dust filters that can prevent any issues impeding airflow. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Temperature, Output Voltage, and Current.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Isolation Short-Circuit Fault:</strong>&nbsp;If there is too much moisture or damage to the cabling sleeves, then an isolation short-circuit fault can occur, whereby the inverter will report an “isolation alarm”. In this scenario, the solar inverter will either work at the minimum “required” isolation level or stop working altogether. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Efficiency, Output Voltage, and Current.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Inverter Does Not Restart:</strong>&nbsp;Inverters sometimes fail to restart after a power outage. Various factors, including a faulty inverter, a tripped circuit breaker, or a blown fuse, can cause this. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Frequency, and Efficiency.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Module:</strong>&nbsp;The MPPT module is responsible for tracking the maximum power point of the solar panel array. If the MPPT module fails, the inverter cannot convert the DC electricity generated by the solar panels into AC electricity. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Temperature, Output Voltage, and Current.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="summary">Summary</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Efficiency challenges in solar farm operations demand a proactive approach to problem-solving, particularly in the context of scheduled diagnostics and high equipment maintenance costs. Anomaly detection emerges as a cost-effective solution, leveraging historical data to identify deviations in parameters like Real-time Energy Output, Power Generation Trends, and Temperature for Solar Panels, along with Output Voltage, Current, Frequency, and Efficiency for Inverters. This approach helps quickly find current problems and predict future issues, which is important for keeping the energy production going without any interruptions.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">To implement this approach, an efficient strategy involves creating anomaly detection models based on historical telemetry data, configuring real-time anomaly detection, and providing a comprehensive dashboard for the maintenance team. This ensures a streamlined process from anomaly identification to resolution, utilizing Trendz Analytics to enhance solar farm efficiency by minimizing downtime, reducing operational costs, and optimizing long-term performance.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">And this is only part of how advanced analytics and machine learning can improve the efficiency of solar farms. With help, you can find solutions to your solar farm problems, including Soiling, Battery Health Diagnostics, and more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At ThingsBoard, we&#8217;ve always been committed to enhancing user experience and system performance. Our latest update, version 3.6.2,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">At ThingsBoard, we&#8217;ve always been committed to enhancing user experience and system performance. Our latest update, version <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/releases/#v362">3.6.2</a>, introduces significant improvements in how images are managed within dashboards, widgets, and more. This update is a key enhancement designed to tackle inefficiencies identified as our user base expanded.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The challenge with large images</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Since the earliest releases, our platform has permitted the embedding of images in dashboards and widgets via external links or Base64 encoded data URLs. While flexible, this approach presented a significant challenge. Users occasionally embedded images up to 50MB in size directly into dashboards. Editing or exporting these dashboards meant transferring massive JSON files to and from the server, a highly inefficient process. This not only affected loading times but also the responsiveness of the dashboard editing experience.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The solution</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">To address this issue, we&#8217;ve introduced a major update in how images are handled within the platform. A central aspect of this update is the introduction of the <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/image-gallery/">Image Gallery</a>. By moving dashboards to a separate entity and utilizing our internal, relative links for storing image references, we&#8217;ve significantly improved efficiency. This change minimizes the size of dashboard JSON files, streamlining both loading and editing processes. The Image Gallery simplifies the process of uploading, organizing, and selecting images.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1604" height="902" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9.webp" alt="Thingsboard image gallery with created time and resolution information" class="wp-image-3704" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9.webp 1604w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9-300x169.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9-1024x576.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9-768x432.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9-1536x864.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9-512x288.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9-920x517.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9-1600x900.webp 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1604px) 100vw, 1604px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Backward compatibility</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The platform&#8217;s upgrade script automatically converts all existing dashboards to the new format. Users can still upload dashboards in the old format to a new platform instance. These dashboards will automatically be converted to the new format during the upload process.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">For example, consider a “Sensors” dashboard with its background image stored in the old format:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-240688aa6d231c0cb4116ec18afee3f6"><code lang="" class="">{
...
"backgroundImageUrl": "data:image/webp;base64,iVBORw...JRU5ErkJggg=="
...
}</code></pre>



<p style="font-size:16px">After the upgrade, a new image will be created in the image gallery:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2406" height="1353" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit image form with option to change name and loaded photo" class="wp-image-3708" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image.webp 2406w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image-300x169.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image-1024x576.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image-768x432.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image-1536x864.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image-2048x1152.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image-512x288.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image-920x517.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image-1600x900.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-image-1920x1080.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The image name is auto-generated based on the dashboard name and the dashboard element where the image is used. This same behavior applies to images used in widget configuration: markers, backgrounds, etc. The dashboard now references the image using the following link:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="json" class="language-json">{
...
"backgroundImageUrl": "/api/images/tenant/sensors_dashboard_default_background.webp"
...
}</code></pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Private and public image links</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Images can be provisioned at the system and tenant levels. System-level widgets are accessible to all platform users, while tenant images are available to authorized users of specific tenants.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">To embed an image into an Angular HTML template, such as the Markdown widget, HTML section in the widget editor, custom actions, etc., use the following code snippet:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="">&lt;img [src]="'/api/images/tenant/sensors_dashboard_default_background.webp' | image | async" /&gt;</code></pre>



<p style="font-size:16px">The <code>image</code> pipe automatically adds the necessary authentication headers to the image request, allowing the same relative image URL to return different content for users from different tenants.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">However, custom widgets or static HTML blocks that do not support Angular HTML syntax cannot add authentication headers to requests. Therefore, every platform image also has a unique URL for downloading the image without authentication. Using the following code snippet, you may embed an image into the components based on the plain HTML. Such components include HTML card widgets, cell content functions, etc.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="">&lt;img src="/api/images/public/ZA4biARtpnl970l0j8MMolRKM56fbpK1" alt="&amp;quot;Sensors&amp;quot; dashboard default background" /&gt;</code></pre>



<p style="font-size:16px">Each code snippet is unique to its image, and you can find the corresponding snippets in the Embed image window.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2406" height="1446" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1.webp" alt="Two blocks with text and code blocks with capabilities to copy code" class="wp-image-3886" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1.webp 2406w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1-300x180.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1-1024x615.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1-768x462.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1-1536x923.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1-2048x1231.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1-512x308.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1-920x553.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1-1600x962.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Embed-image-1-1920x1154.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Caching</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Our image API now utilizes ETags to optimize caching, ensuring that images are only re-downloaded when they have changed. This approach significantly saves bandwidth and improves load times. While we don&#8217;t apply Cache-Control headers by default, users have the flexibility to customize caching behavior through environment variables, including settings for image ETags cache TTL, maximum cache size, and browser cache TTL for both system and tenant images. These settings are crucial for balancing between reducing server load and ensuring content freshness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2406" height="1353" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard.webp" alt="Demonstration photo of relations between Client and Server" class="wp-image-3713" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard.webp 2406w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard-300x169.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard-1024x576.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard-768x432.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard-1536x864.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard-2048x1152.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard-512x288.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard-920x517.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard-1600x900.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ThingsBoard-1920x1080.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The platform offers environment variables to control caching behavior:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">CACHE_SPECS_IMAGE_ETAGS_TTL<strong>:</strong> Controls the cache TTL for image ETags. The default is set to 44640 minutes (31 days), after which the cache is cleared.<br></li>



<li style="font-size:16px">CACHE_SPECS_IMAGE_ETAGS_MAX_SIZE<strong>:</strong> Determines the maximum ETags cache size on the server. The default is 10000. Setting this to 0 disables the cache. <br></li>



<li style="font-size:16px">CACHE_SPECS_IMAGE_SYSTEM_BROWSER_TTL and CACHE_SPECS_IMAGE_TENANT_BROWSER_TTL<strong>:</strong> These settings manage the browser cache TTL for system and tenant images, respectively, with a default of 0 minutes, meaning caching is disabled by default.</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">These settings allow administrators to adjust the balance between performance and content freshness as needed.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Improvement Summary</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">By tackling the challenge of image management within dashboards, we aim to offer a more efficient, robust, and user-friendly platform. Following the upgrade of <a href="https://thingsboard.cloud/">thingsboard.cloud</a>, we&#8217;ve observed an 86% reduction in the size of the dashboards, and some dashboards now load more than twice as fast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">For solar farms, dirty panels can mean thousands of dollars of lost revenue annually. Panels washed too early or too late – are costs that make up a serious portion of the power plant’s profitability.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">In one of our cases, we worked with a Spanish company, a producer of electricity. They owned a solar power plant with a capacity of 10 MW. They will produce about $260,000 worth of energy per month in ideal conditions. However, the company lost over a fifth of its energy due to soiling problems. In turn, the cost of the cleaning cycle was $50,000. Calculating the losses, it was clear that cleaning on a fixed schedule was showing poor results.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1024x574.webp" alt="Thingsboard dashboard with charts and lists solar panels statistics " class="wp-image-3758" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1024x574.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-300x168.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-768x430.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1536x861.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-2048x1148.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-512x287.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-920x516.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1600x897.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1920x1076.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">To get the best possible results, you need to be sure of 3 steps:</p>



<ol>
<li style="font-size:16px">We have to find the energy losses</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">We need to know the forecast for electricity losses.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">You need to find the best time for the cleaning cycle.</li>
</ol>



<p style="font-size:16px">The key to solving all these questions is advanced analytics. A correctly configured system, like an expert, automatically decides what to do based on real-time and forecasted data and can manage the entire cleaning cycle, from collecting information to turning on the irrigation system or calling a group of cleaners without outside intervention.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Using IoT sensors to track real-time solar generation data, our solution provides actionable intelligence to optimize your cleaning schedule. Here’s how it works:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Sensors are installed to monitor energy production from individual panels. This allows precise tracking of solar output over time.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Advanced analytics calculate expected energy generation based on weather conditions and other variables. The difference between expected and available energy generation is considered energy loss.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Our algorithm evaluates the cost of cleaning against potential energy savings. It forecasts lost revenue accrued each day panels remain dirty.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">When the value of regained energy outweighs cleaning expenses, the system automatically alerts owners it’s time to wash or turn off/on the cleaning system.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Targeted cleanings restore generation at the optimal moment. You have the opportunity to adjust the cleaning schedule based on the economic feasibility of your decisions.</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Customers using our solar IoT solution have increased generation by 5-15% while reducing cleaning costs by up to 40%. Solar assets stay active at peak efficiency by timing cleanings precisely when needed.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="effective-solar-panel-cleaning-how-to-optimize-solar-panel-cleaning-schedule">Effective Solar Panel Cleaning. How to optimize Solar Panel cleaning schedule</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Our approach to solving this problem is based on Soiling cost calculation.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Soiling costs are the losses you will incur if you clean your station on this day. This indicator consists of&nbsp;<strong>the cost of cleaning</strong> for a 10 MW plant, which is approximately $50,000,&nbsp;<strong>the sum of all losses</strong>&nbsp;due to pollution, and all this is divided by the number of&nbsp;<strong>days</strong>&nbsp;since the last cleaning.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The indicator drops – good because our costs are decreasing. The indicator starts to rise – you need to wash the panels because the current costs are at their lowest point and then will constantly grow, and that is exactly the point when cleaning is economically feasible. As we can see in the table, in the dry period, when the loss indicators are only growing, the 5th week is the best time to carry out the cleaning cycle because compared to cleaning in any other week, the price is the lowest.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="669" data-id="3759" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation-1024x669.webp" alt="Grid with solar panel cleaning schedule" class="wp-image-3759" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation-1024x669.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation-300x196.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation-768x502.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation-1536x1004.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation-2048x1339.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation-512x335.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation-920x601.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation-1600x1046.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation-1920x1255.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soiling-cost-calculation.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">That is why we need to set up an IoT system with advanced analytics to optimize the cleaning schedule based on the historical data from the solar plant, the production forecast, and the metrics we explained in this section.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="summary">Summary</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants have many advantages, but due to their novelty, they also have many disadvantages. One of the most common is overspending based on pollution. This is a problem that cannot be eliminated, so the goal – is to minimize losses. Using IoT technologies and advanced analytics, you can easily monitor and wash solar panels at exactly the point in time when cleaning is economically feasible.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Analytics, IoT, and machine learning provide insights, risk forecasts, and data-driven decisions for better business performance. Embracing these ensures competitiveness and risk mitigation. Also, in the future, we plan to tell you how to improve the efficiency of the power plant by finding anomalies in the solar panels and parts of the power plant, such as the inverter or the battery. In our digital age, advanced analytics are the way to simplify and boost complex problem-solving!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">Solar energy is becoming increasingly popular as the world looks to resolve the climate emergency and move toward a greener future. However, solar farms face several energy-generating challenges, including operating and maintenance costs, soiling, performance degradation over time, security and intrusion detection, optimizing energy output, and grid integration challenges.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">To address these issues, they increasingly rely on advanced analytics to optimize their operations, monitor weather conditions, and raise maintenance processes. Here, we’ll explore the main challenges faced by solar panels, as well as options for solving them with the help of advanced analytics.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Threshold business analytics approaches cannot deal with the complexity of solar power plant data and the problems that arise. Predictive maintenance, forecasting, and anomaly detection will be the main tools for solving challenges. Solar farms adopting such smart analytics tools have already seen benefits like 12-15% gains in annual energy yield, 15-20% drops in cleaning and maintenance costs, and 30% reductions in power output volatility. By leveraging these tools, solar farms can significantly increase their overall efficiency, reduce downtime, and lower their overall cost of operation.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The article aims to educate readers on the problems and the solutions to aid faster industry adoption of analytics. Continued efforts in this direction can help solar power advance strongly towards its promise of a brighter, cleaner energy future.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="solar-farm-structure">Solar Farm Structure</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar farms consist of solar panels, wires, inverters, batteries, and a utility meter. Due to the design features, each of these areas must be in constantly changing conditions, which causes many problems that require a quick solution.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">With the help of IoT technologies, we can take indicators that the analytics system can later store, process, and convert into previously unattainable parameters.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-the-difficulty-of-solving-challenges">Understanding the difficulty of solving challenges</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Before identifying the main challenges, it is important to understand their complexity and difficulty. We have identified 3 main causes for the decrease in overall efficiency:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The first</strong>&nbsp;is the large number of important metrics that need to be collected for analysis. A solar farm consists of hundreds or even thousands of devices. Each of the devices has a bunch of different parameters that are important for monitoring efficiency. No matter how much we reduce and simplify the system, even a 5 MWh system will have over 10,000 panels. The panels are connected to many inverters and batteries. And they, in turn, are connected by many connections. Accordingly, the system contains a huge amount of data, which is important to operate within a pile.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The second</strong>&nbsp;is the instability of parameters due to changing weather conditions and the sensitivity of solar panels to external factors. This makes it impossible to identify patterns and set simple thresholds. A 15% drop in energy production may be due to a passing cloud rather than a breakdown, soiling, or misconfiguration. With parameters constantly shifting, spotting true problems becomes near impossible for standard threshold-based monitoring tools.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The third</strong>&nbsp;is the inability of humans to process large amounts of data in real-time to take action to improve the situation. But quick action is essential to maximize productivity. So, the system requires machine intervention when it comes to large arrays of constantly changing indicators.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">However, a mature advanced analytics system contains built-in instruments that can help us solve the challenges described. Here are a few of them:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="561" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1024x561.webp" alt="Circulation of solar farm building challenges" class="wp-image-3828" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1024x561.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-300x164.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-768x421.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1536x842.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-2048x1122.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-512x281.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-920x504.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1600x877.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1920x1052.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">So, advanced analytics can work with large amounts of data, find unusual patterns within it, and make the necessary decisions independently to achieve maximum efficiency.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Now that we understand the complexity of overcoming challenges and the tools that help solve them, we can proceed with a detailed overview of each challenge and possible solutions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-main-challenges-in-solar-farms">The main challenges in solar farms</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="operational-and-maintenance-costs">Operational and Maintenance Costs</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">One of the main challenges solar power plant owners face is the significant operation and maintenance costs associated with maintaining these facilities. The main reasons for high expenses are:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Replacement or maintenance of faulty components</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Panel cleaning</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Equipment wear and tear</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Labor costs</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar panels are sensitive to many environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, dust in the air, and other environmental indicators that accumulate over time. Not only do they reduce energy production efficiency, but they also require frequent maintenance and cleaning, which increases overall operating costs.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Here are the most common issues with solar plants that accumulate over time: Delamination and Internal Corrosion, Electrical Issues, Hot Spots, PID Effect, Snail Trail Contamination, Overheating, Isolation Short-Circuit Fault, Inverter Does Not Restart, and MPPT.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">If you want to learn more about this topic, see a full description of the problems and their solutions using anomaly detection, and check out the detailed step-by-step&nbsp;<a href="https://wp.thingsboard.io/optimizing-solar-parks-efficiency-advanced-anomaly-detection-solutions/">guide here</a>.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Expenses such as these can account for up to 15-20% of the total annual cost of solar generation. Traditional maintenance practices often follow a fixed schedule, leading to inefficiencies, unnecessary downtime, and excessive operating costs.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar plant managers can use predictive analytics to foresee potential problems before they become costly downtime. This proactive approach minimizes the need for reactive or scheduled maintenance, optimizing the efficiency of the solar plant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="soiling">Soiling</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The accumulation of dust, dirt, grime, snow, sand deposits, and bird droppings on solar panels blocks incident sunlight to the cells and is a prime source of efficiency losses for solar farms.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Manual cleaning of soiled panels to restore generation is laborious and costly and only offers temporary respite against recurring soiling triggered by environmental or seasonal weather. The high frequency of cleaning needed for farms in specific locales also exponentially increases associated water usage and labor costs. Furthermore, traditional visual inspections for contamination suffer from inaccuracy due to limited manpower and subjective assessments that tend to underestimate early contamination.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Research shows soiling alone can lead to a staggering 7-30% decline in power generation for farms in deserts, near farms, highways, or colder regions. For instance, in some parts of the United States, the soiling rate can range from 0.03 to 0.15% per day, while in desert environments, the soiling loss can be as high as 0.5% per day. These generation gaps for solar farms with tens of thousands of panels placed in arrays covering different geographical regions lead to multimillion-dollar losses.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The way to solve soiling on solar farms with advanced analytics is to use forecasting and comprehensive calculation of the costs of soiling. By finding the perfect balance between the cost of cleaning and the prediction of pollution losses, the system based on real-time data can create a cost-effective cleaning schedule for specific areas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="573" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks-1024x573.webp" alt="Dashboard with chart and list of statistics " class="wp-image-3853" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks-1024x573.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks-300x168.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks-768x429.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks-1536x859.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks-2048x1145.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks-512x286.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks-920x514.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks-1600x895.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks-1920x1074.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anomaly-tasks.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The system can provide a comprehensive report based on actual data, offering an overview of the solar farm’s condition and details about the optimal time for cleaning the solar panels. Additionally, the system can control the activation and deactivation of the nozzles or any other automated cleaning system at the most suitable time.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="performance-degradation-over-time">Performance degradation over time</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Another problem faced by solar power plant owners is the progressive degradation of generating capacity over the lifetime of a plant, which spans decades.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The long-term impact of natural factors, such as solar radiation, moisture, thermal cycles, and mechanical loads, leads to slow wear and tear of components over many years. Delamination, color change, hot spots, and microcracks in the panels lead to an annual drop in conversion efficiency and electrical output of 0.5-1%.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">For a 100 MWh solar power plant, over 25 years of operation, this steady degradation leads to a 10-20% net drop in electricity generation, which means millions in lost profits. Owners also face uncertainty in accurately predicting the degradation trajectories of equipment of different ages located at different sites. False estimates lead to revenue losses due to inaccurate power sales contracts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="643" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1024x643.webp" alt="Grid with solar farm statistics" class="wp-image-3852" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1024x643.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-300x188.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-768x482.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1536x964.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-2048x1285.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-512x321.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-920x577.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1600x1004.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1920x1205.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Moreover, solar panels do not only degrade over time. The connection elements, inverters, batteries, and performance monitoring sensors lose effectiveness over time. It should also be noted that because the equipment is open to unplanned complete failure, solar farms may require short- and medium-term replacements.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">However, at the same time, we should keep in mind that electricity generation on solar farms is unstable. Therefore, it is not possible to tell the difference between changes in weather conditions and degradation by setting thresholds or simply looking at the indicators.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Advanced analytics allows us to identify long-term and short-term degradation, thus solving this problem. In addition, understanding when the best time to reinvest in equipment replacement is an advantage that will help you maintain the highest possible return on your investment over time.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The system constantly checks indicators from many parts of the solar power plant, making it possible to track the overall condition and degradation of individual areas. Not only is it possible to calculate, but accurate degradation monitoring will help avoid revenue losses caused by unpredictable degradation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-and-intrusion-detection">Security and Intrusion Detection</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants are often located in remote locations and are large installations covering large areas. Therefore, expensive equipment such as inverters and solar panels face significant security and intrusion risks from external intruders. These risks can take many forms, causing huge financial and operational losses.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Theft and vandalism are common, with thieves attempting to steal valuable copper wiring and hackers tampering with energy infrastructure, causing power outages. Natural disasters such as forest fires, storms, and floods also create problems that threaten fencing, cables, and monitoring infrastructure. Additional risks, such as unauthorized access to control rooms or electrical sites through broken gates, also create security risks.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Without reliable monitoring tools, these threats often go undetected for long periods, allowing attackers to cause significant damage. Even traditional legacy security systems, such as motion detectors and surveillance cameras, have blind spots where cunning attackers can bypass detection. Patrolling security also offers inconsistent protection based on a large geography. The lack of real-time context also makes threat response ineffective.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Modern analytics platforms offer comprehensive coverage, analysis, and tools to protect solar power plants better. Sensor data analytics can dynamically monitor multi-factor threats. Algorithms can detect anomalies that indicate potential perimeter breaches. Smart cameras or drones can also detect intruder signals and send alerts to dispatchers faster. The information obtained from the cameras and drones can work in conjunction with other data from the solar farm, giving access to almost complete control over the security of the solar farm. Based on historical data from past interventions, you can build the best strategy to eliminate interference in the future.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="optimizing-energy-output">Optimizing Energy Output</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants face the challenge of optimizing energy production due to inconsistent access to their main fuel &#8211; sunlight. The energy output changes during the day depending on the sun’s intensity and between days depending on the changing weather conditions.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Complex factors such as cloud cover, temperature, humidity, dust, and vegetation growth also dynamically affect the irradiance falling on the panels.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Starting with potential fines for under-delivery of electricity under power purchase agreements and ending with the impossibility of profitably participating in spot electricity markets based on the fact that there is too much energy to store in batteries of the available capacity. That is why it is important to use complex calculations and forecasts to find the projected energy production for the coming days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-1024x640.webp" alt="Chart with consumption forecast" class="wp-image-3854" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-1024x640.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-300x188.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-768x480.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-1536x960.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-2048x1280.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-512x320.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-920x575.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-1600x1000.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast-1920x1200.webp 1920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Consumption-forecast.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Advanced analytics allows you to detect generation problems by detecting anomalies or forecast problems by predicting them and triggering preventive, corrective actions to eliminate them. The analytical system can also analyze on a minute-by-minute basis whether it is better to take energy from batteries, solar panels, or the system, thus optimizing electricity bills. Such an automated system can significantly reduce electricity bills for households/factories and maximize profits for solar farms.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="grid-integration-challenge">Grid Integration Challenge</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The volatility of solar generation, which is dependent on weather conditions, creates significant challenges for grid integration. Solar energy production changes rapidly depending on cloud cover and time of day, causing voltage and frequency fluctuations for utilities if not appropriately handled. For grids with a high penetration of solar facilities, this variable generation, if increased, can challenge the stability and reliability of the grid.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">There are 3 types of system connection to the grid: distributed systems (off-grid), centralized energy (on-grid), and hybrid systems.</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Distributed generation is small solar photovoltaic panels (usually from 5 to 500 kilowatts) installed on residential or commercial properties, and solar panels satisfy the main demand for electricity.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Centralized generation is large centralized solar parks, usually with a capacity of hundreds of megawatts, which are connected to the power grid via high-voltage power lines. The main difference between off-grid and on-grid systems is that in centralized power generation, all the energy produced goes from the panels to an inverter, which is converted into alternating current and sent almost directly to the utility grid. In a distributed generation, the energy is stored in batteries and used by a residential or commercial facility as needed.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Hybrid generation differs because it contains batteries and can power a local building and connect to the utility grid.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1704" src="https://wp.thingsboard.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems.webp" alt="Three images which are showing the models of solar panel work" class="wp-image-3850" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems.webp 2409w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems-300x212.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems-1024x724.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems-768x543.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems-1536x1086.webp 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems-2048x1449.webp 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems-512x362.webp 512w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems-920x651.webp 920w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems-1600x1132.webp 1600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/On-Grid-Off-Grid-and-Hybrid-Solar-Systems-1920x1358.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Problems such as voltage spikes, protection discoordination, phase distortion, and unexpected voltage drops can occur when solar power exhibits instability and unpredictability.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Without effective climate change adaptation, problems range from nuisances like flickering lights to catastrophic large-scale blackouts due to cascading power line failures. The economic costs of unreliable renewable generation also reduce investor confidence in further expanding solar power to meet decarbonization goals.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Predictive forecasting combined with optimization for unexpected situations provides actionable information about the future variability of solar generation. Grid operators can take proactive steps to redirect generators, limit the capacity of solar power plants, or deploy batteries to smooth out fluctuations. Real-time anomaly detection also continuously monitors any new equipment limitations or stability risks.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Optimized algorithms prescribe ideal storage vs generation decisions hourly when combined with predictive modeling of dynamic electricity spot prices. Over a year, farms have achieved as much as 5-7% upside in annual revenues besides minimizing deviation penalties.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="first-steps-to-solving-problems">First steps to solving problems</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">We realized which problems occur in solar panels. We understood how to solve them with the help of advanced analytics. So finally, let’s define an action plan on how to make it happen with the help of the ThingsBoard IoT platform and Trendz for advanced analytics:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Collect data from the solar farm site into an IoT platform for processing. Most equipment is capable of&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/integrations/">reporting data using Modbus, MQTT, HTTP protocols</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/">gateway data loggers</a>. We need to collect the following information: 
<ul>
<li>Data from weather stations &#8211; solar irradiance, temperature, humidity, etc</li>



<li>Metrics from Inverters &#8211; input and output voltage, current, frequency, etc.</li>



<li>Metrics from solar panels or Strings &#8211; voltage, operating time, panel temperature, panel orientation, etc.</li>



<li>Metrics from batteries or energy storage systems &#8211; voltage and current, state of charge, temperature, etc.</li>



<li>Information from energy meters and grid &#8211; real-time energy flow, power quality data, grid demand response, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Set up a monitoring dashboard in the IoT platform that will&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/dashboards/">visualize collected data in real-time</a>.</li>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar farms, due to their design factor, have a large number of challenges that require constant intervention and monitoring of the overall condition of the farm. The main challenges are operating and maintenance costs, soiling, performance degradation over time, security and intrusion detection, optimizing energy output, and grid integration challenges.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Effectively handling these challenges is the basis for the high efficiency of a solar farm.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">However, manual reading of indicators or setting thresholds is not enough for power plants with unstable energy production. Using advanced analytics will open up new horizons of efficiency and reliability for your solar farm. The future looks bright for the partnership between solar and advanced analytics!</p>

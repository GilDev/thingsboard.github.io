<p>Liquid level monitoring system is a process that involves the use of various technologies to accurately detect the liquid level in a tank. This method is critical to a wide range of industries, including water treatment, chemical manufacturing, food and beverage, oil and gas, and many others that require precise control of liquid volumes for operational efficiency, safety, and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>The purpose of Monitor level in a tank is to provide real-time data on the amount of liquid stored, enabling efficient management of liquid resources. It helps prevent overfilling or depletion of critical stocks by creating automatic alerts when liquid levels are too high or too low. As well as ensuring operational continuity and safety, tank fluid levels monitoring systems can also provide information on fluid temperature to optimize resource use, improve environmental sustainability and reduce costs associated with storage and supply chain management</p>



<h2 id="anchor-2">The Explanation how Liquid level monitoring system works</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-zebYbEY3inkJLr57Pqv1i4nT?se=2024-04-16T08%3A23%3A41Z&amp;sp=r&amp;sv=2021-08-06&amp;sr=b&amp;rscc=max-age%3D31536000%2C%20immutable&amp;rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3D7ac8d8fb-bd2c-404c-b581-ef800a305434.webp&amp;sig=P47sLG/llFL87I4400EzzURQROvmT43qYyFNkKrLQgs%3D" alt="" /></figure>



<p>This monitoring can be carried out using a variety of sensors such as ultrasonic sensors, radar level sensors, float switches and pressure sensors, which can measure liquid levels without direct contact with the liquid or by direct immersion in the tank or reservoir. The sensor is mounted on the lid of a closed tank or suspended by a rod or rope over an open tank. Once installed, the sensor can check the amount of liquid in the tank. These sensors typically work by sending signals (sound waves in the case of ultrasonic sensors or electromagnetic waves for radar sensors) to the surface of the liquid and measuring the time it takes for the reflected signal to return. The distance calculated from this time allows the system to determine the liquid level in the tank.<br>This gives the ability to remotely monitor the liquid level from anywhere in the world using a web application or smartphone, making it easy to track of the liquid levels in real-time.</p>

<h3 id="anchor-4">Practical Uses of liquid level monitoring system</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-YVde3PFrnz6psT3DH5BZW86Z?se=2024-04-16T08%3A26%3A10Z&amp;sp=r&amp;sv=2021-08-06&amp;sr=b&amp;rscc=max-age%3D31536000%2C%20immutable&amp;rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dda19d292-c00c-49fb-ba32-2f848a9d8181.webp&amp;sig=SI7pwO0jyXH0pVZdak/2qXuStlzeXpPTr/oPXtcCn3A%3D" alt="" /></figure>



<p><strong>Oil &amp; Energy Industry</strong><br>Crude oil and its derivatives are the lifeblood of the oil, petrol and energy industry (H/T to natural gas, but crude oil takes the cake here). We need tanks to store these liquid substances and everything they help produce.</p>



<p>For example, oil, petrol and energy companies use tanks upstream for production storage, production chemicals, and fracking water management. Midstream, tanks serve as temporary storage for crude products and distributed inventory for specialty chemicals and other liquids needed for industrial processes. We also see tanks used downstream in terminal storage, tank farms, and hydrocarbon processing. On the distribution side, tanks hold fuel, lube oil, and various petrol’s products, such as liquid propane and heating oil.</p>



<p>As Four you can see, tanks are important up and down the oil and energy production line. With tank level monitoring, we can efficiently track liquid hydrocarbons every step of the way.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for Oil &amp; Energy in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hauling companies use smart tank sensors during custody transfers to track how much oil or water they pull from central tank batteries</li>



<li>Oil and gas operators use tank level monitors to monitor chemical inventory and usage related to promoting asset integrity or maintaining flow assurance</li>



<li>Commercial businesses use tank level monitors to measure diesel consumption rates for backup generators or automate stock-out notifications for underground gasoline storage tanks</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Water &amp; Wastewater Industry</strong> <br>Water impacts every aspect of our lives, making water security a TOP priority for leaders and organizations in numerous fields. For example, we use water for fracking in large oil and gas projects. We need water to irrigate our crops, produce our food, and manufacture our favorite beverages. And the only way to ensure we have the water we need is through effective wastewater treatment!</p>



<p>The wastewater treatment industry is a huge stakeholder in promoting water security, which is where remote tank monitoring comes into play. With remote tank sensors, we can monitor distributed water resources that are vital for maintaining water security.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for wastewater treatment in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Treatment plant operators use tank level sensors to monitor separation in quiescent basins and track disinfecting chemical supply</li>



<li>Saltwater disposal facilities use tank monitoring to track liquid volumes for disposed and injected wastewater and prevent overflows in storage tanks</li>



<li>Waste management companies rely on smart tank sensors to collect data around methanol usage rates for leachate treatments and prevent leaks or spills in clarifier tanks</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Agriculture Industry</strong><br>If crude oil is the lifeblood of the energy industry, then water is the lifeblood of the agriculture industry. Obviously, plants and crops can’t grow without water.</p>



<p>If we don’t keep a close eye on water storage, we run the risk of depleting our water before it’s too late to restock. Similarly, we have to stay on top of liquid fertilizer to maintain production quality and regulatory compliance. Enter remote tank level monitoring.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for agriculture in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Agriculture companies use tank monitors to track treatment rates for chemigation</li>



<li>Operators depend on smart tank level sensors to monitor fertilizer and additives inventory for irrigation processes</li>



<li>Sustainable agriculture farmers use tank monitoring to track rainwater collection and ensure livestock have enough to drink</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Food &amp; Beverage Industry</strong> <br>Few recipes work without some type of liquid. In food and beverage production, we use liquids like water, milk, oil, dyes, and other substances that humans consume on a regular basis. And wherever we need liquids, we need tanks that we can monitor!</p>



<p>With remote monitoring, we can track our liquids usage to ensure we produce high-quality food and beverages</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of remote tank monitoring for Food &amp; Beverage Industry in action:</p>



<ul>
<li>Food and beverage producers use tank level monitors to monitor market-ready output of beverages</li>



<li>Manufacturers use tank sensors to track the usage of additives, like dyes and emulsifiers, that are used in many food production processes</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Chemicals Industry</strong><br>Specialty chemicals are used in countless applications and sectors. For instance, we use industrial chemicals to support production, transportation, and refinement in the oil and gas industries. Chemicals are also used in the fertilizers that we apply to crops and the additives we put in food and beverages. Chemicals, like water, are everywhere.</p>

<p>There are a large number of oil level sensors available &#8211; smart Wi-Fi tank level monitoring systems, tank content gauges, visual oil level gauges, clock oil level gauges, electronic oil tank monitors, all of which perform the same function &#8211; read the contents remaining in an oil tank. The sensor is mounted on the lid of a closed tank or suspended by a rod or rope over an open tank. Once installed, the sensor is able to check the amount of liquid in the tank and related telemetry. To do this, it sends a wave through the liquid and measures the time it takes for the wave to reflect off the liquid surface. The device collects this information from the sensor and sends it to our IoT visualization platform.</p>



<p>This gives the ability to monitor oil levels remotely from anywhere in the world via a web or smartphone app, making it easy to keep track of the amount of liquid in any tank.</p>

<li>Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP)</li>



<li>Total dissolved solids (TDS)</li>



<li>Conductivity</li>



<li>Water turbidity (water clarity)</li>
</ul>



<p>There is a possibility to track not only water tanks but also pressure of water pump<strong> </strong>and use<strong> </strong>smart switch which operates in automatic mode &#8211; when the water level is low, the switch automatically turns on the pump, and when the water level in the tank is full, the switch turns off the water supply.</p>



<p>Besides IoT monitors smart water wireless monitoring system include next necessary components:</p>



<p><strong>Power supply</strong>: In most cases IoT devices are energy efficient and do not require a lot of power. The are two popular types of power supply &#8211; batteries with high energy density and high voltage (lithium batteries) and energy harvesting technologies for extracting power from the surrounding environment such as solar energy, thermal energy, mechanical energy, environmental energy.</p>



<p><strong>Connectivity</strong>: There are two popular types of wireless IoT device connection to IoT visualization software. The first one is Local area networks (LAN) using Wi-Fi for short-range communications . The second is wide area networks (WAN) using cellular (NB-IoT), satellite communication and radio network (LoRaWAN, Sigfox) for wide-range communications.<br>Integration with<strong> </strong>IoT Visualization software.<strong> </strong>Once IoT devices are connected and powered up, the last step is to integrate them with IoT visualisation software to get a picture of the water tank&#8217;s content. <strong><a href="https://TLM/ Generic">ThingsBoard</a></strong> is IoT visualisation platform which provides a tank monitoring dashboards with real-time data visualisation, trend analysis, usage history. Ready to use Water Level Monitoring template allows easily monitor the status of the tank, set up measurement details and custom automatic alerts like low water levels, opening and closing pumps and valves to detect leaks or theft, also track water consumption.</p>

<h3 id="anchor-3">Remote water level monitoring</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-9vam4ou7N6XUyWYTE9pHdp9h?se=2024-04-16T08%3A29%3A41Z&amp;sp=r&amp;sv=2021-08-06&amp;sr=b&amp;rscc=max-age%3D31536000%2C%20immutable&amp;rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3D8525890e-fc99-4635-86af-de1c5342a1ec.webp&amp;sig=oRuvoE/qGeNxl%2BymeJgl/Bbn/NgYI%2BvR1bkp%2Bzw01Wo%3D" alt="" /></figure>



<p>A remote water level monitoring system collects data on the status of water tanks 24/7. The type of TLM vary depending on the industrial, commercial or domestic use.<br><br>There are different types of domestic water tanks: overhead water tanks that install on the rooftop, open top-tanks installed on ground and underground water tanks. All this water tanks accomplish one main goal &#8211; supply house with necessary amount of water.<br>In domestic usage IoT device connectivity via Wi-Fi connection will be good choice for short-range communications within a specific location. TLM system provide convenient possibility to monitor water tank via Mobile App, tablet or Web Interface using PC.</p>



<p>In commercial usage water tanks are commonly used by water delivery companies to track the quality of the water delivered, as well as by health resorts to store sufficient amount of drinking water. In this case, IoT sensors that support wireless radio communication may be more appropriate, as companies often need to continuously monitor water condition even in rural areas where cellular coverage is limited.</p>

<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Message publishing</strong>: Conveniently publish messages with the ability to customize various MQTT-related settings for tailored communication.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MQTT 5: Flow Control</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="365" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-1024x365.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4028" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-1024x365.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-300x107.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-768x274.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-1536x547.png 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-2048x729.png 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-512x182.png 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-920x328.png 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-1600x570.png 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-3200x1140.png 3200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-1920x684.png 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2.png 3212w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">This update contains the Flow Control feature, a crucial enhancement for managing the rate of message flow in MQTT communications. This feature is particularly important in scenarios where clients or brokers have limited processing capabilities or bandwidth.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>How It Works:</strong> Flow Control in MQTT 5 is achieved through a key parameter: Receive Maximum. It dictates the maximum number of QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages that the client or broker is willing to process concurrently. Receive Maximum is exchanged within the CONNECT and CONNACK packets. Its default value is 65,535 based on the MQTT specification.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Why It&#8217;s Needed:</strong> Flow Control is an essential mechanism for several reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Preventing overload:</strong> Without Flow Control, there&#8217;s a risk of overwhelming a client or broker with more messages than it can process. This can lead to system lags, or in worst-case scenarios, cause crashes or unresponsiveness, particularly in smaller, less powerful devices.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Ensuring reliable communication:</strong> By controlling the flow of messages, MQTT ensures that data transmission remains stable and reliable.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Optimizing resource use:</strong> Flow Control allows for the efficient use of system resources. It ensures that devices are not bogged down by unnecessary processing tasks, which is particularly important in systems with limited computational power.</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Use Case</strong>: It can be any scenario (e.g. a smart home system or a traffic management system) where devices are constrained by processing power and cannot handle transmitting or receiving large amounts of data efficiently.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MQTT 5: Request-Response pattern</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="428" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-1024x428.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4029" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-1024x428.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-300x126.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-768x321.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-1536x643.png 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-2048x857.png 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-512x214.png 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-920x385.png 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-1600x669.png 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-3200x1339.png 3200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-1920x803.png 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2.png 3212w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The MQTT 5 Request-Response pattern introduces a structured approach to communication, enabling devices to send requests and receive responses in a reliable and efficient manner.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>How It Works:</strong> In the Request-Response pattern, a client sends a request message to a specific topic, typically indicating the action it wants to perform. This request includes essential parameters such as the Response Topic and Correlation Data. The recipient, which may be another client or application, processes the request and issues a corresponding response message directed to the specified Response Topic. This response provides the result or acknowledgment of the request. Utilizing Correlation Data, the original requester can precisely match the received response to its corresponding request, ensuring seamless bidirectional communication.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Why It&#8217;s Needed:</strong> The Request-Response pattern addresses the need for synchronous communication in IoT systems, where devices often require immediate feedback or confirmation for their actions. By establishing a structured request-response flow, MQTT 5 ensures a reliable and timely exchange of information between devices and applications.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Use Case:</strong> Consider a home automation scenario where a user wants to remotely control their smart lights. The user sends a request message to the TBMQ, specifying the action to turn on the lights. The broker transmits the request to the receiver which executes the action and sends the response message back to the user, confirming that the lights have been successfully turned on. This bidirectional communication allows for seamless interaction between the user and the smart home system, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other notable enhancements</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">In addition to the features highlighted earlier, this release includes several points that strengthen the system&#8217;s reliability and efficiency. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Significant enhancements have been made in backpressure management specifically for non-persistent subscribers. This improvement allows the system to handle data flow surges for these subscribers more efficiently by implementing rate limits. As a result, it ensures the system&#8217;s stability, maintaining consistent performance even under conditions of high demand.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The enhancement of the disconnect client command with Reason Codes marks a notable improvement, offering clearer insights into disconnection causes (e.g. &#8220;Session taken over&#8221;, &#8220;Administrative action&#8221;) and facilitating more targeted troubleshooting and analysis.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">This version brings improvements in memory usage and overall performance. An important resolution of a direct memory leak issue leads to an optimized operational environment. This results in reduced latency and higher throughput, significantly boosting the system&#8217;s performance and robustness.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2406" height="1773" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1.webp" alt="Form with seven options which configure grouping intervals for dashboard time window " class="wp-image-3793" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1.webp 2406w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-300x221.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1024x755.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-768x566.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1536x1132.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-2048x1509.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-512x377.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-920x678.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1600x1179.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1920x1415.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<p>The update introduces new grouping intervals for dashboard <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time window</a> configurations: <strong>Week (Sun-Sat)</strong>, <strong>Week (Mon-Sun)</strong>, <strong>Month</strong>, and <strong>Quarter</strong>. The intervals adjust to the browser&#8217;s time zone by default, but there&#8217;s also the option to set a custom time zone for further customization. These additions allow for more flexible and granular data visualization and analysis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Button widgets</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="263" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets.webp" alt="Five blocks with icons and text" class="wp-image-3794" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets.webp 802w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-300x98.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-768x252.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-512x168.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve improved our platform with the new button widgets: the <strong>Action Button</strong> <strong>widget </strong>for navigation to other dashboards, states, or custom actions; the <strong>Command Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for sending commands to devices, updating attributes, or appending time-series data; the <strong>Toggle Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for switching between two device states; the <strong>Power Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for toggling the device on and off. Each widget is designed to offer users more control and interactivity within the platform, improving the overall experience. Explore the full potential of the new button widgets in the dedicated <a href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/iot-widgets-for-enhanced-dashboards-introducing-the-action-command-toggle-and-power-buttons/" data-type="link" data-id="/blog/iot-widgets-for-enhanced-dashboards-introducing-the-action-command-toggle-and-power-buttons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Control widgets</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="305" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets.webp" alt="Three blocks with toggle button and one with slider" class="wp-image-3795" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets.webp 802w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-300x114.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-768x292.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-512x195.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re introducing Control widgets: the <strong>Slider Widget</strong> and the <strong>Toggle Button Widget</strong>. Both widgets have a simple configuration interface and allow users to trigger commands to devices, update attributes, or append time-series data for the target entity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Alarm comment support for edge instances</h2>



<p>This feature enables bidirectional synchronization of comments on alarms between edge and cloud instances. With this update, users can seamlessly add comments to alarms directly within the Edge environment, and these comments are synchronized with the ThingsBoard cloud instance in real time, ensuring consistency and transparency throughout the entire system. Additionally, comments added or modified in the cloud instance are automatically propagated to the Edge environment, ensuring that all operators have access to the latest information regardless of their location or the system they are using.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Now, you can receive instant alerts and updates directly on your smartphone, making it easier than ever to stay connected with your IoT devices. Whether you&#8217;re monitoring temperature changes, tracking device status, or just want to stay informed, our new push notifications ensure you&#8217;re always in the loop. Get ready to elevate your IoT experience with real-time alerts wherever you are.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Firebase setup</h4>



<p>To deliver notifications from ThingsBoard instances to mobile apps, we utilize <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firebase</a>. To set up push notifications, create a Firebase project and provide the necessary Firebase credentials to both the platform instance and the mobile application. For setup instructions, community edition users should follow this community edition <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/mobile/getting-started/#step-4-optional-configure-push-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>, while professional edition users can refer to the professional edition <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/mobile/getting-started/#step-4-optional-configure-push-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to Use Notifications</h4>



<p>After setting up the platform and your app, you can start using the notification center to send out alerts. You can do this in two ways: manually or automatically with notification rules.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Sending Notifications Manually</h5>



<p>Open the &#8220;New notification&#8221; wizard by following this <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#send-notification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>. Specify target recipients and choose &#8220;Mobile app&#8221; as the method for sending your notification. Please note that the recipient must install and login to the mobile application before the notifications may be sent. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1920" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit rule settings form with eight fields" class="wp-image-3870" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-300x239.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1024x816.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-768x612.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1536x1224.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-2048x1632.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-512x408.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-920x733.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1600x1275.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1920x1530.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>In the next step, you&#8217;ll be able to personalize your notification. This includes choosing a subject, writing the message, and picking a custom icon to appear in the mobile app&#8217;s notification section.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="2070" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard new notification settings form with four fields" class="wp-image-3871" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-300x258.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1024x880.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-768x660.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1536x1320.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-2048x1760.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-512x440.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-920x791.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1600x1375.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1920x1650.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>Notifications can do more than just inform; they can also take users somewhere specific. There are two options for what happens when someone taps on a notification:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Open URL:</strong> This can be any link, inside or outside the app. For internal links, you can direct users to pages like home, alarms, devices, assets, or customers by using these shortcuts: <code>/home</code>,<code> /alarms</code>, <code>/devices</code>, <code>/assets</code>,<code> /customers</code>, <code>/auditLogs</code>.</li>



<li><strong>Open Dashboard:</strong> This option works just like it does for web notifications, taking the user directly to a specific dashboard.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you don&#8217;t set up a tap action, tapping the notification will bring up the notifications page by default.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="880" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1024x880.webp" alt="Smartphone with thingsboard notifications on the screen" class="wp-image-3872" style="width:801px;height:auto" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1024x880.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-300x258.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-768x660.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1536x1320.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-2048x1760.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-512x440.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-920x791.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1600x1375.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1920x1650.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Notification Rules</h5>



<p>Notification rules are your go-to tool for automating alerts based on specific events, making it a breeze to keep everyone informed without manual intervention. A common scenario is sending out alerts for new alarms. These rules can handle everything from simple notifications to complex escalation chains and are highly customizable. Learn more about notification rules <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#alarm-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. See the default rule below. This rule sends information about new alarm to all tenant administrators:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="2466" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit rule settings form with six fields" class="wp-image-3873" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-293x300.webp 293w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1000x1024.webp 1000w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-768x786.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1500x1536.webp 1500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-2001x2048.webp 2001w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-512x524.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1024x1048.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-920x942.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1600x1638.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1920x1965.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>Each rule is associated with a notification <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#templates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">template</a>, which defines the delivery method and appearance of notifications. To get started with push notifications for new alarms, modify the &#8220;New Alarm Notification&#8221; template to include the &#8220;Mobile app&#8221; delivery option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1977" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit notification template settings form with eight fields" class="wp-image-3874" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-300x246.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1024x840.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-768x630.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1536x1261.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-2048x1681.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-512x420.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-920x755.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1600x1313.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1920x1576.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>You can either reuse the message and subject from web notification or create your own. To make your notifications more engaging and relevant, use dynamic content like <code>alarmType</code> and <code>alarmOriginatorName</code>. A full list of available parameters can be found in the built-in documentation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="2040" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit notification template settings form with four fields" class="wp-image-3875" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-300x254.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1024x867.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-768x650.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1536x1301.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-2048x1734.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-512x434.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-920x779.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1600x1355.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1920x1626.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>After setting up your notification templates, you&#8217;re all set to see them in action without the need for any extra setup. For instance, by using the already available <code>Air Quality Monitoring</code> solution template, you can immediately start receiving notifications triggered by the predefined alarms in this solution. This approach lets you quickly validate your notification settings and ensure everything works seamlessly right out of the gate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="880" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1024x880.webp" alt="Smartphone with thingsboard alarm notifications on the screen" class="wp-image-3876" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1024x880.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-300x258.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-768x660.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1536x1320.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-2048x1760.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-512x440.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-920x791.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1600x1375.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1920x1650.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Don&#8217;t stop at alarm notifications. It&#8217;s a good idea to enable mobile alerts for updates, comments, and assignments related to alarms. Explore all the types of notification <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">templates</a> available to fully leverage this feature.</p>



<p>For a seamless user experience, you can link notifications to specific mobile dashboards. When an alarm triggers a notification, tapping on it in the mobile app can directly open the relevant dashboard. This integration is set up in the device profile&#8217;s <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/device-profiles/#alarm-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alarm rules</a>.</p>



<p>Handling your notifications is intuitive:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mark as Read</strong>: Swipe right on a notification.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Take Action</strong>: Swipe left to acknowledge, clear, or delete it.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br>Since launching, our time-series charts have grown a lot but have become harder to configure due to many new features. We decided to make them easier to use and added advanced data zoom capabilities by switching to <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://echarts.apache.org/">Apache ECharts</a>, a popular and powerful charting tool. Below, we&#8217;ll walk through the new widget setup and spotlight the latest enhancements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Time series chart family</h4>



<p>Our new chart family includes four types. The main one, the <strong>time series</strong> chart, lets you show lines, bars, and points all at once. The others are <strong>line</strong>, <strong>bar</strong>, and <strong>point</strong> charts. We&#8217;ll focus on the basic configuration of the time series chart below. The other charts&#8217; configurations and features are very similar.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Time window and data source</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#widget-time-window" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time window</a> and <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#data-source-types" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#data-source-types">data source</a> configurations are similar to other time series widgets. Please note that you may display data from multiple entities using <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entity aliases</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="412" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1024x412.webp" alt="Thingsboard time window and data source configurations" class="wp-image-3749" style="width:798px;height:auto" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1024x412.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-300x121.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-768x309.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1536x618.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-2048x824.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-512x206.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-920x370.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1600x644.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1920x772.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Y axes</h4>



<p>New charts differ from the old ones by offering direct control over the Y-axes setup, influencing how these axes are shown visually. Each chart comes with a <strong>default</strong> Y axis that is fixed and cannot be removed. Initially, any new series or threshold you add will appear on this default axis. However, you have the option to create additional axes and specify these for your new series or thresholds during their configuration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="404" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1024x404.webp" alt="Thingsboard Y-axes setup with default configuration" class="wp-image-3728" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1024x404.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-300x118.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-768x303.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1536x606.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-2048x808.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-512x202.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-920x363.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1600x632.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1920x758.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Configurable options for each axis include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Option to toggle the axis visibility. Even if hidden, it affects the chart if min or max values are set.</li>



<li>An optional label for the axis.</li>



<li>Choice of axis placement: left or right side of the chart.</li>



<li>Minimum and maximum values to set the chart&#8217;s visual range. Leaving these empty enables automatic adjustment based on data values.</li>



<li>Units for the values are displayed next to the axis.</li>



<li>The number of decimal places for value precision.</li>



<li>Selection between line or bar for the axis representation.</li>



<li>Additional settings to adjust the appearance of axis ticks and lines.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Series</h4>



<p>The series table lets you set up which time series data keys to show. You can display each series as either a line or bars, and it needs to be linked to a specific Y-axis. When displaying data from several entities together, you can use <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entity aliases</a> as the data source. To differentiate between data series from various entities, we recommend including <strong>${entityName} </strong>or <strong>${entityLabel}</strong> in the series label. These placeholders will automatically be replaced with the specific names or labels of the entities, making it easier to tell the series apart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="409" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1024x409.webp" alt="Thingsboard series table with default config" class="wp-image-3729" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1024x409.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-300x120.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-768x307.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1536x614.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-2048x819.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-512x205.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-920x368.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1600x640.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1920x768.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Configurable options for each series include:</p>



<ul>
<li>A label for the series. Supports <code>${entityName}</code> or <code>${entityLabel}</code> template parameters.</li>



<li>The display style: choose between a line or a bar.</li>



<li>The color for the line, bar, or points.</li>



<li>Units that are displayed next to the value in tooltips.</li>



<li>The number of decimal places for value precision.</li>



<li>Additional settings for managing the series&#8217; appearance in the legend and other visual aspects.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Thresholds</h4>



<p>Threshold settings have been incorporated into the basic widget configurations, maintaining their full functionality while simplifying the process. There are three ways to set thresholds:</p>



<ul>
<li>Using a constant value for simplicity.</li>



<li>Referencing an attribute from the entity specified in the data source.</li>



<li>Referencing an attribute from a different entity, such as an asset, customer, or tenant, offers flexibility in threshold configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Data zoom</h4>



<p>A valuable new enhancement is the introduction of data zoom functionality. This feature enables you to zoom into specific data points or ranges directly within your browser, efficiently and without the need for additional data requests from the server.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="418" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1024x418.webp" alt="Long chart with three lines and data zoom option" class="wp-image-3824" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1024x418.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-300x123.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-768x314.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1536x627.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-2048x837.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-512x209.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-920x376.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1600x654.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1920x784.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tooltip improvement</h4>



<p>The tooltip configuration has been updated to offer more flexibility in formatting data and showing the data&#8217;s time interval. By default, the tooltip will show both the start and end times of the data aggregation period. You now have the option to customize the font and colors for both the actual values and the date labels, as well as the tooltip&#8217;s background, to suit your preferences.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="634" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Tooltip-improvement_1-1024x634.webp" alt="Chart which is showing bars and lines

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other EChart-based widgets</h4>



<p>We have added a few more widgets with slightly different configurations.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Bar chart with labels</h5>



<p>The widget is crafted to compare aggregated data across various entities or multiple data keys. To differentiate between data from different entities, incorporate <code>${entityName}</code> or <code>${entityLabel}</code> into the series label.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1812" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels.webp" alt="Thingsboard bar chart with labels" class="wp-image-3734" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-300x226.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1024x770.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-768x578.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1536x1155.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-2048x1540.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-512x385.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-920x692.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1600x1203.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1920x1444.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Range chart</h4>



<p>The range chart is specifically created to display a single time-series value from one entity, such as a device or asset. A distinctive feature of this chart is the &#8220;Range Colors&#8221; option. This allows you to assign specific colors to different value ranges shown in the chart, enabling a visual representation that matches the value&#8217;s magnitude with color.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="770" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1024x770.webp" alt="Thingsboard range chart which is showing temperature on a time period " class="wp-image-3735" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1024x770.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-300x226.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-768x578.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1536x1155.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-2048x1540.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-512x385.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-920x692.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1600x1203.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1920x1444.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">Ensuring reliable and consistent monitoring of temperature and humidity is crucial for the proper storage of temperature-sensitive medications and perishable food products. Our partner, <a href="https://www.vypin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vypin</a>, has successfully deployed WhereView, a solution powered by ThingsBoard, for a leading global pharmaceutical corporation. This IoT application has significantly enhanced operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="803" height="451" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp" alt="Working conditions on the left side and device on the right side" class="wp-image-3797" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp 803w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-768x431.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-512x288.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The challenge</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposes stringent guidelines on pharmaceutical manufacturers concerning storage conditions and the regulatory compliance of control systems. The client approached Vypin with a request to overhaul their existing system, which failed to meet FDA standards, leading to penalties and the potential for product or ingredient spoilage.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The client&#8217;s primary concerns revolved around data loss. The then-existing devices were prone to disconnections due to various issues, such as network or power failures, leading to lapses in telemetry transmission or recording. Furthermore, the system lacked a mechanism for notifying the client about these disruptions. Additionally, there was no provision for remote access to monitoring data.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="is-style-cs-about" style="font-size:16px">Round-the-clock rotation of operators to control the temperature and humidity in the warehouse indeed is not the best solution. Therefore, in the regular automatic reports related to the storage environment state there were gaps in the tables and graphs. The FDA fines for such violations.</p>
<cite>Customer officer says</cite></blockquote>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">The solution</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">In response, Vypin proposed the Vypin-WhereView system, leveraging ThingsBoard&#8217;s capabilities. The solution involved establishing a wireless network, along with the installation of sensors and gateways.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Addressing the initial concern of data loss, the newly installed sensors were equipped with memory modules to store telemetry data locally. Thus, even in the event of a gateway disconnection, data integrity was maintained. Upon restoration of the gateway&#8217;s online status, it would retrieve and transmit the stored telemetry to WhereView.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">The WareView application, powered by ThingsBoard, resolved the outstanding concerns of reliable data processing and storage and enabled differentiated access levels. Designated personnel were granted comprehensive access, allowing them to monitor data from all warehouses at any time and location. In contrast, warehouse managers were provided with tailored access rights, enabling them to oversee only their specific warehouses.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">Accessing the dashboard, which displays various graphs and tables, simply requires logging into the system from a web browser.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">A noteworthy feature is the customized notification system, established through ThingsBoard&#8217;s rule engine and device profiles. This system alerts the relevant individuals in case of deviations from preset conditions, such as temperature threshold breaches. This feature facilitates immediate response and the implementation of preventive measures.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">The outcome</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Prevention is universally acknowledged as more efficient, cost-effective, and less time-consuming than cure. With the newly installed warehouse monitoring system, the client now has the capability to proactively prevent issues before they arise, ensuring the safety and integrity of their sensitive products.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">This case study exemplifies the power of IoT in enhancing regulatory compliance and operational efficiency in critical industries such as pharmaceuticals. The Vypin-WhereView solution, backed by ThingsBoard, demonstrates our commitment to delivering innovative and reliable monitoring solutions.</p>
